            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>And when he had removed him (viz.</hi> Saul) <hi>he raiſed up unto them</hi> David <hi>to be their King; to whom alſo he give Teſtimony, and ſaid, I have found</hi> David <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>a man after mine own heart, which ſhall fulfill all my Will.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN which words we have a ſummary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Man after God's own heart, in this Example of <hi>David;</hi> whom (when <hi>Iſrael</hi> would needs have a King) the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did find out, and raiſe up, and recommend unto his People, with this ſingular Teſtimony; which is worthy of our enquiring thereinto as we would be able to judge of our ſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in a Caſe of ſo high concernment.</p>
            <p>Now this General Teſtimony here, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre unto ſome other Scriptures, from whence it's ſeveral parts are borrowed. That he was <hi>found out</hi> of God is atteſted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 20. and that he was <hi>after God's own heart,</hi> is affirmed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14; and as an Evidence thereof it is here further added, <hi>which ſhall fulfill a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll; viz.</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Saul,</hi> who is there ſaid,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102526:3"/> 
               <hi>not to have kept that which the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him,</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>But if we would more Diſtinctly know, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his being after Gods own heart conſiſted, we cannot have a ſurer guide than to conſider what is left upon record in the Scripture concerning him, both in the Hiſtory of his Life, and in his Book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> And it may be obſerved, that there is no one man in the Old Teſtament ſo much ſpoken of, as <hi>David</hi> is; that ſo we might be the better able to underſtand the full Latitude and Meaning of what is here laid down in more General terms.</p>
            <p>Now unto this purpoſe we ſhall find, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is deſcribed in the Scriptures, both in a way of comparing him with <hi>Saul,</hi> and alſo, as he was in Himſelf more Abſolutely conſidered: Both which Branches of his Commendation, do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpring from the Root of this Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is Comparatively deſcribed, or in a way of Comparing him with <hi>Saul.</hi> Which Branch of his Deſcription is clearly intended here, as is evident, from the Commendation that is here given of him, together with the mentioning of his being ſubſtituted in the others ſtead, and as the Reaſon why <hi>Saul</hi> was Removed, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> Raiſed up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is yet more fully ſignified in thoſe other Scriptures which this Teſtimony referreth unto, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. &amp; 15. 28. Now as <hi>David</hi> was an Example, of a Man after God's own heart; ſo alſo was <hi>Saul</hi> of a meer Carnal man, whatever his Profeſſion may be, or his Attainments, in ſome other reſpects. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102526:3"/> this Comparative Deſcription of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> is both fairly offered from this Scripture, and of ſingular uſe to be enquired into.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi> may thus Comparatively be ſaid to be a man after Gods own heart, whether we ſhall conſider <hi>David</hi> at his Worſt, or <hi>Saul</hi> when at the Beſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It cannot be denyed, but that <hi>David</hi> had many failings, notwithſtanding all which, he was yet to be preferred far before <hi>Saul,</hi> as will appear upon our obſervation of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, recorded in the Hiſtory of his life: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may alſo underſtand, what kind of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are moſt apt to abound among Carnal Profeſſors, ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> ſometimes was; and more eſpecially in thoſe Dayes, wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s promiſed Diſpenſation draweth nigh, which is of uſe for us in theſe later dayes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe Temptations which did Principally bear rule in <hi>Saul,</hi> are as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Saul</hi> accepted of his outward Dignity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very Many, Great, Known, Moral Rubs, that lay in his way; wherein he yet perſiſted, and without the leaſt Reluctancy. He knew that he was deſired, by a company of poor carnal Creatures onely; whoſe Vote alone, a Gracious heart would not have been guided by; and therefore <hi>David</hi> was wont to conſult with another ſort of Perſons, upon every of his more than ordinary undertakings, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29. 25. Nay and <hi>Saul</hi> did alſo know, that he was Deſired by thoſe carnal <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that ſo they might be like unto all the Nations, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102526:4"/> 8. 5, 20; although they were expreſſely charged, not to walk after the Doings of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> Lev. 18. 3. Whereas, a gracious heart is taught, not to be conformed unto this World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2, according to the courſe whereof Unbelievers walk, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Saul</hi> alſo knew, that this Choice of theirs, was unto <hi>Samuel</hi>'s grief, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 6; and againſt the Revealed Will of God, and unto his Rejection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and without any juſt Cauſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advantage was taken by them, from the miſcarriages of <hi>Samuels</hi> Sons; which at the moſt was only Perſonal, and not to be charged upon that Form of Government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.4, 5. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>David</hi> was moſt tender of offending the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 15: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſinning againſt the Lord himſelf; who alſo did not therefore reject Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe of thoſe humane frailties that did atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them. Nay and <hi>Saul</hi> alſo knew what manner of Perſon the Lord had foretold their King ſhould be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, becauſe of whom they ſhould one day cry out, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. which one would think might have a little bridled his Ambition, as it would have done any mans, ſave his, and <hi>Hazaels,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 12, 15. <hi>Saul</hi> alſo knew that this Choice of theirs was witneſſed againſt, by God himſelf, who had declared it to be ſome kind of Idolatry, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 8; and did Providentially hint his being highly diſpleaſed at it, by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble Tempeſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 17, 18, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple did confeſs that this was their ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 19. Notwithſtanding all which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102526:4"/> Rubs, <hi>Saul</hi> did accept of his being choſen; which <hi>David</hi> would never have done, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his forbearing to take the Crown, untill his way was made very plain before him. From all which we may inferre, that a Carnal Profeſſor is apt to be guided by the Major Vote; and doth not ſtick at the point of Conformity, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo againſt the mind of Chriſt; nor is he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with offending the Godly party, or with complying with ſome kind of Idolatry; nor with the Rejecting of God's Appointments; but will adventure upon a worldly Temptation, let what will follow; nay, though that God himſelf doth witneſs unto the Evil of ſuch a thing, both by his Word and Providence, ſo as that ſome of his own party are forced to confeſs it. This may a Carnal Profeſſor doe; and this is one ſin that will prevail in the latter dayes; and to perſiſt in a ſin of this nature, is one ſad Character of him who is not after Gods own Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>Saul</hi> was Providentially advanced unto place of Power, he made his Subjects Slaves, and his own corrupt Will the Rule of his Actions, and not the Revealed Will of God. This is evident from the Deſcription of that King whom the People were then mad of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11; which <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf did witneſs unto, when he made that offer of Fields and Vineyards unto ſuch as would take his part, and ſide with his wicked Intereſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 7. And this is another character of a meer carnal Profeſſor according to that meaſure of Rule that he is inveſted with. He is wholly for himſelf, and for the ſatisfying of his own deſire, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102526:5"/> how much his private Intereſt is raiſed upon anothers ruine; He ſeeketh his own, and not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. He deviſeth iniquity and practiſeth it, <hi>becauſe it is in the power of his hand,</hi> Mic. 2. 1. He is apt to be a provoking Parent to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a tyrannical Maſter to his Servants, a racking Landlord unto his Tenants, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Magiſtrate to thoſe that vex him, and one that dealeth hardly with his own enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience, ſo far as it ſtandeth in the way of his worldly Intereſt. Whereas a Gracious Heart doth Rule over others in the fear of God, knowing that he alſo hath a Father, and Maſter, and Lord, and King in Heaven, whoſe Subject he doth approve himſelf to be. But <hi>Sauls</hi> ſelfiſh Domineering Spirit, is one of the Carnal mans Diſtempers, by the cheriſhing whereof, he is diſcovered to be ſuch a one. And this kind of Corruption doth alway go along with that form of Government, which is after the manner of the Nations, and will continue, till <hi>Davids</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation be advanced.</p>

This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Diſtemper is incident to ſuch a ſort of Perſons eſpecially in the latter dayes; the bold and preſumptuous prevailing whereof, doth ſadly ſignifie, that ſuch are not men after Gods own heart; and that they ſhall be Removed from ſuch a place of Dignity, which otherwiſe they ſeemed likely to have had eſtabliſhed upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When <hi>Saul</hi> was in a ſtrait, he then was for conſulting with God before the Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 18; where God promiſed to meet the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 29. 42, 43; and where the chief Ruler was ordered to ſtand before the Prieſt, who was to ask counſel for him, and at whoſe word the Ruler and his People were to goe out and come in, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 21: but when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102526:6"/> the Danger was over, <hi>Saul</hi> bad the Prieſt to withdraw his hand, having no leiſure then, nor apprehending any need to conſult with God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 19. And thus meer carnal Profeſſors in the day of their Diſtreſs, may conſult with God and his chief Prieſts, or moſt eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but not ſo much from reſpect unto a Divine Command, as from the urgency of their preſent Caſe; who therefore can diſpenſe with their Duty, if either they be not urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or if it ſeem to interfere with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Intereſt. An Hypocrite will not <hi>alway call upon God, nor delight himſelf in the Almighty,</hi> Job 27. 10. If there be any other way open, <hi>through the pride of his countenance he will not ſeek after God,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. Untill he be put in fear, he is apt to think that himſelf is God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 20. He ſeeth no ſelf-worth in Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, nor any great need thereof, ſave as his outward advantage doth preſs him into ſuch a Service. He can pray when he hath nothing elſe to doe; but otherwiſe, his Duty is a Clog, which he would gladly have withdrawn. Let him but have the Creature on his ſide, and then let God goe where he will. This is another of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, who are of <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Saul</hi> was a ſetter up of Duty of his own Deviſing, when he did ſo raſhly curſe thoſe that ſhould eat any thing untill the Even, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24, by which means he troubled the Land, <hi>v.</hi> 29. and hindered that Victory which he thought to have furthered, <hi>v.</hi> 30; making the People to be very faint, <hi>v.</hi> 31. and occaſioning their ſin, in eating Blood, <hi>v.</hi> 32: all which was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102526:6"/> the juſt fruit of his forbearing to take God's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>v.</hi> 19: Such another piece of his blind Zeal was alſo evidenced in his ſlaughter of thoſe <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> which his Poſterity were made to pay for, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1, 2, 9. And thus a carnal <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> is very forward to make void a lawfull Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſuch as that was which <hi>Joſhua</hi> made with thoſe <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> ſeeking to deſtroy ſuch who differ from himſelf, though never ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a Civil reſpect; which courſe will end at laſt in the ruine of his own Name: Such alſo are apt to coin a Religion of their own; bitterly curſing them that will not comply with their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Inventions; whom the Generality are over-awed to fall in with, unto the occaſioning of much after-ſin and trouble: All which is the conſequent of their not enquiring of God, and unwillingneſs to be directed by him. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Profeſſor hath a Zeal for God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. And when he perſecuteth ſuch as God would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he is apt to think that he doth God good ſervice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. He diſregardeth his real Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thinketh to make amends by impoſing upon himſelf and others what is of his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing. In the midſt of his Deſpiſing God's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he would be thought to be Religious ſtill; who at the ſame time doth neglect his Body in a way of Will-worſhip, and hazard the ruine of his Soul in a way of Diſobedience. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Gracious Soul, or a man after Gods own heart, is very fearfull of perſecuting any, and of Adding unto or ſubſtracting from, the Laws and Commands of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>And thus a carnal Profeſſor, is apt to waxe worſe and worſe, notwithſtanding his former Warnings; and in his conflicting with worldly Temptations, he may be very exact as to what is of little uſe or worth, but will venture to ſpare the Chiefeſt of them, unto his own utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw in the iſſue. He will needs retain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Worldly Nature ſtill, which yet ſhall be deſtroyed, as <hi>Agag</hi> was by <hi>Samuel,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> had forfeited his Crown by the diſcovery of his Diſpoſition. And ſuch a ſpirit will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the latter dayes, a little before the Saints being Anoynted for outward Rule, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s diſobedience herein did <hi>David</hi>'s being Anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, who was a Type of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s High ones, unto whom the Dominion muſt be given, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding that <hi>Saul</hi> knew himſelf to be thus notoriouſly guilty, yet when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to meet him, he falſly boaſted that he had performed the Commandement of the Lord; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 13. And thus a carnal Profeſſor is apt to proclaim his own goodneſs, though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6; and to boaſt himſelf of a falſe Gift, like a Cloud and Wind without Rain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 14.

He will give a true Saint his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102526:8"/> Praiſe, if himſelf may but be ſuffered to ſhare therein. One principal part of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to applaud himſelf, and then eſpecially when he doth leaſt deſerve it. He knoweth what is his Duty, and will therefore pretend highly unto his performance of it, when he hath been moſt Neglective. Vapourers are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly but ſuſpitious perſons; of which ſort there will be, in the laſt dayes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2.

And thus a carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor will flatter himſelf in his own eyes, untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 2. And nothing will make him confeſs, but a Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right proof, or undenyable Demonſtration. He

He pretendeth to deſign the advancement of Gods Worſhip, in his Retaining of thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things, which he is bid to let goe, in the faithfull diſcharge of his Duty. If you will believe him, he doth not love the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſave as he may be thereby made further ſerviceable. He counteth it no better than a ſacred Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, when any good thing is bid to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, wherein Man's prudence may rectifie a Scriptural miſtake.

            <p n="9">9. When <hi>Samuel</hi> had further urged this Sin which was ſo clearly proved, and in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; yet <hi>Saul</hi> was moſt notoriouſly Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in replying ſtill, that he had obeyed the Lords Voice, and had gone in his way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 20. A carnal Profeſſor hath a Brazen face, and is apt to think that his Affirmation is better than any ones Denyal. He will juſtifie himſelf before men, but God knowes his heart, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. He will run the utmoſt hazard, rather than give Glory to God by a free Confeſſion.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102526:9"/> He will bid his Opponent to ſay on, as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Samuel;</hi> but is reſolved to hold his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, although he cannot anſwer the others Argument. He placeth Victory in having the laſt word, whether it be true or falſe. If he can but be Confident, he doubteth not but his Cauſe will have the better. <hi>Saul</hi> knew that <hi>Samuel</hi> was a Prophet, and though he heard him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that what he now ſaid was from the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 16, yet did he labour to out face him. A carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> may arrive at ſuch an height; and Impudency is a clear ſign of ſuch a one, which <hi>David</hi> was far from being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When <hi>Saul</hi> could no longer deny the thing, he then Tranſlated the Guilt from off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the People, as if it had been their Act alone, and not his alſo, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. Which if he had confeſſed at the firſt, it might have been more eaſily believed. A carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſon of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who covered his tranſgreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 33, by Dividing all the Blame between his Wife and God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12; pretending that he had never eaten the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, had it not been given him by his Wife; nor ſhould he have had ſuch a Tempter, had not God given him that woman to be with him: Wherein we may obſerve, the Man's ſubtlety and Boldneſs, above the Woman's; for ſhe only did blame the Serpent, <hi>v.</hi> 13, but He alſo did charge God fooliſhly; and thus the more there is of fallen <hi>Adam</hi>'s Manlineſs in any, the more do they abound in this Preſumptuous skill, of raiſing their own Reputation upon the Ruines of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102526:9"/> Anothers. Such will moſt boldly call in for that Proviſion, which they will leave others to Pay for, when the Reckoning cometh; which is one ſign of a ſordid diſpoſition. He may be known to be one of Satan's Scholars, whoſe faculty doth lie in ſuch kind of Tranſlations. Whereas <hi>David,</hi> in a like Caſe was forward to juſtifie the People, and to condemn himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 17, although the People were the ſole Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe of that ſad miſcarriage, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Saul</hi> did confeſs at laſt, that he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but with an hypocritical extenuation of his fault though, as if it had ariſen more from his fear of the People, than from any love that he had unto the Spoil, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. An hypocrite will alway detain ſomething of God's Due, in the beſt Payment that he maketh. And yet how plainly did his Nakedneſs appear through theſe Fig-leaves. The People knew, that this was the Command of God by <hi>Samuel,</hi> as well as he; who therefore could not blame him for putting it in execution. He feared not the People, when he did Adjure them from eating food; which was a greater Provocation than this could be. He was one that had Courage enough, but when it might ſerve his Intereſt, he would ſeem as if he were a Coward. A formal Profeſſor's ſelf-abaſement is the Fruit of Pride; it is for ſome wicked End when he croucheth and is humble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 10. He is not aſhamed to declare, that he feareth Man more than God. He ſuppoſeth it to be a ſufficient Plea, if his tranſgreſſion be apprehended to be the fruit of fear. Such mince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words are a clear Evidence of an unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102526:10"/> heart, which <hi>David</hi> was never guilty of.</p>
            <p n="12">12. When <hi>Samuel</hi> would not be ſatisfied herewith, nor think this laſt Excuſe worthy of a Refutation, but was turning away from him, then <hi>Saul</hi> did confeſs that he had ſinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Extenuation added: but yet withall his Mind did now run more upon his being Honoured before the People, than upon his former Sin, or preſent Duty, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30; though <hi>Samuel</hi> had but newly told him, that God had Rejected him, <hi>v.</hi> 26; and rent the Kingdom from him, <hi>v.</hi> 28, and would not Repent, <hi>v.</hi> 29. A proud carnal Profeſſor's Intereſt, doth chiefly conſiſt in the Preſervation of his worthleſs Honour. He would be well accounted of, although he is convinced of his real Vileneſs. He worſhippeth God, that ſo he might be ſeen of Men. He doth not count ſin to be his Shame, but onely the Knowledge of it, which therefore he ſeeks to hide. He will confeſs it privately to prevent a more publick Notice. His undeſerved good eſteem is dearer to him than a Kingdom. His ſelf-condemnings are meerly extorted from him, and leave no impreſſions upon his Spirit ſuiting with his words. The Nature of Sin doth not afflict him, but onely the Conſequents thereof; and may he but have the Praiſe of Men, he is able to bear the want of the Lord's Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. <hi>David</hi>'s thoughts at ſuch a time were working in a far other way; as his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were more Quick and Cordial: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Saul</hi> did not Roundly come off with his Confeſſion, untill there was no room left for God's Repenting.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102526:10"/> 13. After this time, <hi>Saul</hi> was a terrour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faithful <hi>Samuel,</hi> who went in the fear of his Life, whileſt in the purſuance of his Duty, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 2; and in the mean time, the chiefeſt of <hi>Sauls</hi> Herd-men, was <hi>Doeg</hi> an <hi>Edomite,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 7, who boaſted himſelf in miſchief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 1, and loved evil more than good, <hi>v.</hi> 3, and ſtrengthened himſelf in his wickedneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 7: whereby <hi>Saul</hi> evidenced plainly, that he was neither a Man after Gods own heart, nor yet a Magiſtrate properly of God's Ordaining; ſince thoſe Powers that are Ordained of God, are ſaid to be, not a Terrour to Good works but to the Evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 3. But by this means, <hi>Saul</hi> ſerved as a dark Foil, to ſet off <hi>David</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Luſtre; and ſuch a ſort of Civil Rulers ſhall uſher in the Saints promiſed Dominion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may hence learn, that a carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor is apt to Hate him unto the Death, who offereth to advance <hi>David</hi>'s Intereſt, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that expreſs word, which the other cannot gainſay to be Divine. He may patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear that Truth, which he will not endure the practiſing of, by himſelf or others; in which caſe, he will prove their deadly Enemy, whom he hath formerly ſeemed to love and reverence: The truth is, he careth not for the Beſt man's Company, when himſelf is by ſuch diſtaſted; and if ever he can get the leaſt colour of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it will ſoon appear, what kind of good will he beareth to them; whileſt men of looſer Principles and Practices are his chiefeſt Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, in caſe they will but pleaſe his humour, although they have not ſo much as the Name of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102526:11"/> 
               <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And indeed, it is a ſufficient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a carnal man, when he can fall in with <hi>Edomites,</hi> who came of <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 36. 9, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Elder brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 25, who ſold his Birthright, <hi>v.</hi> 33, and therewith loſt the Bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 35, which cauſed Enmity between them and their Poſterity: which <hi>Edomites</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit Types of ſuch, who are nearly related to God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, but do yet hate them, becauſe of thoſe Bleſſings which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath conferred upon them.</p>
            <p n="14">14. So ſoon as <hi>David</hi> was Anoynted King, <hi>Saul</hi> was troubled with an Evil Spirit, ariſing from his Guilt and Diſcontent, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13, 14; which he endeavoured to Play away, <hi>v.</hi> 17, being adviſed thereto by ſome of his Servants, <hi>v.</hi> 16; and accordingly <hi>David</hi> was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, <hi>v.</hi> 18, by whoſe Muſick he was for a while Refreſhed, <hi>v.</hi> 23. And let it be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether ſuch a male-contented ſpirit in ſome, will not accompany the Saints being Anoynted for their Rule, which will be ſomewhat aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as they ſhall be advanced into favour. However, we may learn from hence, that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſor, when troubled in his Spirit, is apt to make uſe of poor ſenſual Diverſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, which may have ſome Repercuſſive Influence, but will never prove an effectual cure. He wanteth not ſome or other to adviſe him to ſuch a courſe, and he is very apt to take that counſel. He is more ſenſible of ſuffering than of ſin, and would be glad of Eaſe, by any means whatever. And in ſuch a Caſe he will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſome preſent refreſhing, although it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102526:11"/> prove unto the Aggravating of his ſorrow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. He is of an Earthy Spirit, and is apt to think that Creature-comforts can ſpeak Peace to a troubled Conſcience. A <hi>David</hi> ſhall find favour in his ſight, if he have but ſo much cunning, as to make him chearfull. He would have Comfort, although it doth not belong unto him, which if the Lord will not give, he will then trie ſome other means. He loveth a gracious man, not becauſe of his Graces, but becauſe of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward refreſhing, by means of his acquaintance with him. And if he doe but overcome his Qualms, he is Refreſhed, and (in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion) well. But <hi>David</hi> himſelf did never go this way to work, in a caſe of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>Saul</hi> envied <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip him, and was very wroth with thoſe, who did but give <hi>David</hi> his deſerved praiſe, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that Victory which he had wrought, by ſlaying the <hi>Goliah,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> durſt not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with; who yet would have had all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and miſſing of it, he was vexed, and eyed <hi>David</hi> from that day and forward, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 7, 8, 9. A carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is uſually very Proud, and not eaſily ſatisfied with his full Due, in point of recompenſe. He cometh in the Rear, as to his Duty; but would be in the Front of thoſe who are Rewarded. He valueth his own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements at a very high rate, although they be far inferiour unto what he would have ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another. He loveth the uppermoſt Seat, and is very angry if any one be preferred before him. He is not well-pleaſed with thoſe who will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102526:12"/> not lift him up; and looketh upon ſuch with an Evil eye, who are eſteemed of above himſelf. A gracious heart may have Temptations unto Envy, but the Prevalency and Indulging of this Diſtemper, is a very bad ſign, and will diſcover it ſelf in due time more fully.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Saul</hi> was a moſt notorious Diſſembler, with Man, as well as with the Lord; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he would give <hi>Merab</hi> his elder daughter unto <hi>David;</hi> onely he would firſt have ſome further Proof of his faithfulneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, by ſome freſh attempts upon the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines;</hi> but did by that means deſign and hope for <hi>Davids</hi> ruine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 17: and when he promiſed him <hi>Michal</hi> the younger daughter, he pretended that it was from Love, <hi>v.</hi> 22, but did intend her for a Snare, <hi>v.</hi> 21. A man after Gods own heart is Upright, and is therefore apt to be Beguiled by another, as <hi>David</hi> was: but a carnal Profeſſor will dare to Juggle moſt egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly. <hi>Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil Eye, for as he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he; Eat and drink, ſaith he to thee, but his heart is not with thee,</hi> Prov. 23. 6, 7. <hi>His words are ſofter than Oyl, yet are they drawn ſwords,</hi> Pſal. 55. 21. He ſpeaketh fair, when he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth miſchief; and gildeth over his moſt deadly Poyſon. If <hi>David</hi> be not very watchful, this groſs Diſſembler will be too many for him.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Notwithſtanding his great Profeſſion, yet <hi>Saul</hi> would curſe and lie; both which are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 59. 12, and in relation to <hi>Saul,</hi> as the Title of that Pſalm doth evidence. And that he was a Liar, appeared in the breach
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102526:12"/> of his Promiſe to <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Merab,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 17, whom afterwards he gave unto another, <hi>v.</hi> 19. A gracious heart is loth to be accounted Light in what he promiſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, being taught of God to put away Lying, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25; but a carnal Jew will Lye, <hi>Rev.</hi> 39; which he will not ſtick to doe, who can diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He giveth juſt occaſion to the World to ſay, that Profeſſors will Lye, although they will not Swear. Let a <hi>David</hi> take heed, that he doth not too much depend upon the Promiſe of ſuch a man. He can Diſpenſe with his Word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be nothing in it that is unlawfull to be performed. The cheriſhing of which Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, doth ſufficiently evidence, that ſuch a man is not after Gods own heart.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>Saul</hi> was a Perſecutor of <hi>David</hi> unto the death; he became his Enemy continually, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 29; ſpeaking to <hi>Yonathan</hi> his Son, and to all his Servants, that they ſhould Kill him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 1; ſeeking himſelf to ſmite him to the wall, <hi>v.</hi> 10; and ſending Meſſengers unto his houſe to ſlay him, <hi>v.</hi> 11; and being vext with <hi>Michal,</hi> that ſhe did not betray her own Husband, <hi>v.</hi> 17; and caſting a Javelin at his own Son <hi>Jonathan,</hi> becauſe he did but ask, why <hi>David</hi> ſhould be ſlain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 32, 33; proffering at an high rate unto ſuch as would take his wicked part, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 7, 8; and ſlaying eighty five Prieſts, with all their Subſtance and Relations, meerly becauſe one of them had Ignorantly ſupplyed <hi>David</hi> with what he needed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18, 19. Which Perſecution was no way juſtly deſerved by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 59. 3; but meerly becauſe the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102526:13"/> Lord was with him, therefore was <hi>Saul</hi> afraid of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 12, 15, 28, 29; and becauſe he ſaw that <hi>David</hi> was better than himſelf, which made him think that he was the man whom <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> had ſpoken of. Nay <hi>Saul</hi> did ſometimes confeſs that <hi>David</hi> was Innocent, and better than himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17, who yet purſued him after that. And though he had ſworn that <hi>David</hi> ſhould not be ſlain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 6, yet did he afterwards purſue him with greater violence than ever: And notwithſtanding all <hi>David</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſerviceableneſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 5, and after-good deſerving at <hi>Saul</hi>'s hand, when he ſpared his Life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 11, yet did <hi>Saul</hi> follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, untill he heard that he had fled the Land, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 4. Which ſpirit of Perſecution will eminently appear in the latter dayes, and is an evident Character of a meer carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour.</p>
            <p n="19">19. When the Lord would not anſwer <hi>Saul,</hi> he then conſulted with the Devil, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6, 7; though he had cut thoſe off who had Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Spirits, <hi>v.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 11. A carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> will in his ſtrait uſe any the moſt unlawfull Means that are. If Meekneſs will not accompliſh his deſign, he can and will make uſe of ſinfull Paſſion, or that Wiſdom which is Earthly, Senſual and Deviliſh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 14 15. If the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> be come into <hi>Immanuels</hi> Land, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 8. the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors there will ſeek unto them that have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Spirits, <hi>v.</hi> 19; debaſing themſelves even unto Hell, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 9; conſulting with carnal Policy, and complying with that <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> way
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102526:13"/> of Worſhip, which they have formerly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt. Such are reſolved to ſecure their worldly Intereſt, and when their formal Duty will not do it, they will experiment the benefit of Diſobedience, having heard that the Gods of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> have ſometimes helped them, which yet will prove unto profeſſing <hi>Iſraels</hi> ruine, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 23.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>Saul</hi> took a Sword and fell upon it, from the meer pride of his heart, leaſt thoſe uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed <hi>Philiſtines</hi> that had wounded him, ſhould come and thruſt him through, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. A carnal Profeſſors Stomack will not yield unto the laſt. Rather than he will bear the leaſt Appearance of Diſgrace, he will be Acceſſary to his own deſtruction. He Glorieth in his Shame, and counteth that Bravery, which is indeed Self-murther. He is more ſolicitous about his Reputation, than about his Everlaſting ſtate. The Saints Adverſaries ſhall at the laſt deſtroy themſelves. And the final prevailing of ſuch a wilfull ſelf ruining diſpoſition, doth evidence a <hi>Saul-</hi>like Spirit, who was not one after God's own heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principal of <hi>Saul</hi>'s regiſtred Miſcarriages; and partly in relation thereunto, <hi>David</hi> is here ſaid to be after God's own heart, becauſe (when at his worſt) he never did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a Deſparate Frame of Spirit as was in <hi>Saul,</hi> conſidering both the Subſtance and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe Diſtempers before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this is the firſt general Branch of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Comparative Deſcription.</p>
            <p>From whence I ſhall now proceed unto the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102526:14"/> Second, which is this, That <hi>David</hi> will appear to have been a Man after Gods own heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring him with <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> was at his Beſt; or in relation to thoſe Good things and Vertues that were at any time to be found in him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which he Differed in Kind from what <hi>David</hi> was, in point of Goodneſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may alſo underſtand, how far a meer car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſor may proceed, in a way of Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endowments, and Religious actions.</p>
            <p>And ſo, in the General, 'tis ſaid, that upon the Change of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Outward condition, the Lord gave him <hi>Another Heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9. Which though it be here chiefly meant of his being Qualified for Kingly Rule; yet doth it fairly hint unto us, that a meer carnal Profeſſor may be in ſome ſence ſaid to have Another Heart, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et is not after the Heart of God. In a Natural reſpect, Man's heart or ſpirit is Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that of Bruits, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 21; and yet in a Spiritually Moral ſenſe, the Heart or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome Men is called Bruitiſh, <hi>Jude</hi> 10. Thence it is, that we read of Diverſe Spirits, which we are bid to trie, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4, 1. as well as Works or Actions. And as ſome men are more Groſſely Carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3; ſo ſome are Animal, or more Refined, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14; both which do yet differ from him that is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Spiritual, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Saul</hi> was but a Carnal <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi> comparing him with <hi>David;</hi> and yet he had Another manner of Natural Spirit than the reſt of his Companions, whom yet he did only Excell, as one Bruit doth excell another. As gracious Actions have their Counterfeits, ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102526:14"/> alſo have Renewed Principles and Diſpoſitions; and thus a meer Natural man may ſeem to be endued with Another Heart, or be another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man, than himſelf ſometimes was, or than others are; and yet no Difference for Kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, according to a Goſpel-Rule. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>David</hi>'s heart was of another Kind, as true Grace is, and as all the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God are, who are New Creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17: Born again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3; the Workmanſhip of God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10; and Renewed in the Spirit of their Mind, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23, and not only in the Fixedneſs of their Will, as ſome would have it, who make the Difference between Saints and others to conſiſt, not in the Nature of their Oyl, but only in the Strength or Weakneſs of thoſe Veſſels into which it is infuſed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as both in Reaſon and alſo according to the Scripture, the Creature's Will is commanded by the Law in his Mind, and the Conſtancy of a Saints Obedience, doth depend upon the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Heart or Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19, 20. A ſhadow of which Other Spirit may yet be the portion of a meer carnal Profeſſor. So much in the General.</p>
            <p>But more Particularly, we may ſee in <hi>Saul</hi> how far a Natural man may goe, as to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſuch a Diſpoſition. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Saul</hi> was Obedient unto his Father, at whoſe Command he went himſelf to ſeek the loſt Aſſes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 3, notwithſtanding the Goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Perſon, <hi>v.</hi> 2, which would have made ſome others to have ſcorned ſo mean a Service, eſpecially ſince there were Servants, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102526:15"/> work that was. But yet <hi>Saul</hi> went, without any the leaſt unwillingneſs that we read of; and having paſſed through the Land of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raim,</hi> he ſpake of Returning, not becauſe of Wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neſs or the Nature of his Errand, but meerly out of reſpect unto his Father, leſt he ſhould leave caring for the Aſſes, and take thought for him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 4, 5. Let all Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children know, that they are ſo far from being after Gods own heart, as that they come ſhort of <hi>Saul,</hi> or of what a meer Carnal man may attain unto. And let them alſo conſider, that if <hi>Saul</hi> had now been undutifull, he had miſſed of that Crown, which was ſet upon the head of his Duty. But let them withall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is no more than what may be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a common <hi>Iſraelite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Saul</hi> ſometimes evidenced a great deal of Humility. When <hi>Samuel</hi> firſt told him of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 20, he askt him, wherefore he did ſo ſpeak to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was of the Leaſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the ſmalleſt Tribe of <hi>Iſrael, v.</hi> 21; in which reſpect he ſeemed Little in his own ſight, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 17. And after his being Anointed, meeting with his Unkle, and being demanded by him what <hi>Samuel</hi> had ſaid unto him, he told him nothing about his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 15, 16. And when he was choſen afterwards by Lot, he could not be found, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 21, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord found him out where he had <hi>hid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 22. And after that he had been choſen, and owned by the People as their King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 24, yet he returned to look after his Fathers Cattel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 5. And when he did exerciſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102526:15"/> his Regal power, he was content that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould be his Colleague, as appeareth from the tenour of his firſt Proclamation, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 7. All which were viſible Demonſtrations of his great Humility. Let all Proud, vain-glorious ſpirits know, that they are lower by the Head than <hi>Saul.</hi> And let them alſo conſider, that when <hi>Saul</hi> was moſt Humble, he then had moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon him, both by God and Man. But let them withall remember, that a meer carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> may be very little in his own ſight, apprehenſive of his ſmallneſs, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to be advanced; he may not affect to make known what Glory is conferred upon him; he may ſeem unwilling to be preferred before another, and tarry till he be ſought for; he may not be puffed up with outward Dignity, ſo as to deſpiſe or lay aſide a former honeſt Calling; and he may be willing to make a Good man his Aſſociate, in the midſt of his greateſt outward Exaltation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Saul</hi> could command his Paſſion; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his Holding of his Peace, when ſome men did deſpiſe him both by their Words and Actions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27; though he had then a Band of men with him, <hi>v.</hi> 26, and therefore had Power in his hand; though he was then Higher than any of the People, in point of Place, <hi>v.</hi> 24. as well as Perſon, <hi>v.</hi> 23, and ſo was the more provoked; though his Deſpiſers were Children of <hi>Belial, v.</hi> 27, whoſe exemplary Puniſhment would therefore have been the better born; and though <hi>Samuel</hi> and God himſelf had Aſſigned the Kingdom to him, which would have fairly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102526:16"/> coloured over his moſt ſevere proceeding; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which, 'tis ſaid, that he held his Peace. Now what a ſhame is this to many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Profeſſors, who cannot bear the leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an Affront, but muſt give vent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Choler, upon every petty Provocation: which yet is more ſadly Aggravated, when ſuch a Diſgrace doth ſeem to have been Deſerved; and when it is put upon them by the Children of God; and it may be by their Equals, if not Superiors! When at any time we are thus tempted unto ſinfull Anger, let us remember what a Goodly Perſon <hi>Saul</hi> was, in compariſon of us, who yet was not after Gods own heart: and therefore let us neither be thus guilty, nor yet pleaſe our ſelves too much with ſuch a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Saul</hi> was of a very Noble and Couragious Spirit in the Cauſe of God, and of his poor afflicted People. <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth that he was ſtronger than a Lion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 23. An early proof whereof he gave, when he heard of that ſordid uſage which the <hi>Ammonites</hi> did threaten the men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> with, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Anger was kindled greatly, <hi>v.</hi> 6, and though he then had no Army at command, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving betaken himſelf unto his former Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life, <hi>v.</hi> 5; yet did he immediately affright the People into a general Muſter, <hi>v.</hi> 8, by a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute threatning Proclamation, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and ſo De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>livered the Men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> from their Tyrannical Oppreſſors, <hi>v.</hi> 11; and ſo did prevent their Sin as well as ſuffering; ſince they through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Fear had offered to make a Covenant
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102526:16"/> with their Enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 1. directly contrary to Gods Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2. Now theſe <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> deſcended of <hi>Lots</hi> younger Daughter, who being in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Lingring there, by that Means loſt her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 14; and having an inordinate deſire of Children, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of them in an ordinary way, <hi>v.</hi> 31, did thereupon commit Inceſt with her own Father, <hi>v.</hi> 36; whoſe ſpurious Offspring were bitter Enemies unto the Holy Seed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3. 4, although <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not intermeddle with their Inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 19, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 10, 11, whatever was falſely charged upon them, in the dayes of <hi>Jephtah,</hi> Judg. 11. 13, 15: And ſo theſe <hi>Ammonites</hi> do fitly anſwer unto that ſort of Perſons in the latter dayes, who being in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> and lingring there, are by that means tempted unto ſome unlawful complyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under a pretence of being Spiritual Fathers, which otherwiſe they think they could not be; whoſe Offspring have alway been bitter Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to Gods Separated <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and will not be for an Accommodation with them, without the loſs of the others Right Eye, or choiſeſt Light, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2; although they have never been moleſted or wronged by them. And ſome ſuch Deliverance may poſſibly be effected in the latter dayes, a little before <hi>Davids</hi> Diſpenſation doth begin. However, we may learn from hence, that a <hi>Saul</hi> may be very valiant in the Def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce of a righteous Cauſe, and in relieving the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Which witneſſeth unto the ſhame of thoſe Profeſſors who can be Bold enough in a way of ſelf-revenge, but never think their Call
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102526:17"/> clear enough, to ſtand up in the behalf of a Righteous and Publick Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Saul</hi> ſeemed to be very much affected with Gods Goodneſs, in giving him that Victory; and evidenced it, by ſaying, that not a man ſhould be put to death that day, when ſome would have had his fore-mentioned Deſpiſers executed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 12, 13. So alſo when he had overcome thoſe <hi>Philiſtines</hi> afterwards, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14, 31, he built an Altar, <hi>v.</hi> 35; and when he had deſtroyed the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> he worſhipped the Lord in a way of thankſgiving, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 31. A carnal Profeſſor may ſeem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that all his Deliverances and other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies do originally proceed from God. And ſuch do come ſhort of <hi>Saul,</hi> who are onely for the craving of a Bleſſing, and not for the Return of Thanks upon a Mercy received: or when ſome Publick and great Salvation doth not reſtrain a Private ſelf-revenge. But yet we may obſerve, that <hi>Sauls</hi> Thankſgiving was in a more Overly or formal way; whoſe firſt Altar for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was accompanyed with a greater ſin than this Duty did amount unto, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24, 33, 35, and therefore the Lord would not Anſwer him upon his next Enquiry, <hi>v.</hi> 37; and whoſe Deſire to Worſhip the Lord upon his next Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29, was not ſo much upon the account of Duty, as to recruit his Honour, <hi>v.</hi> 30, which <hi>Samuel</hi> was therefore very Backward to joyn with him in, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27.</p>

A carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> may evidence a great deal of ſelf-denying candour, in ſetting forth another's Worth unto his own ſeeming diſadvantage. What ſhall we then think of thoſe, who do what they can to Extinguiſh the Light of Another's Glory, leſt their own ſhould be by that means Eclipſed? Such as refuſe to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto another's Innocency, when called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are worſe than <hi>Saul</hi> was; eſpecially when they will ſeek to raiſe their Own, upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved Ruines of anothers good Name.</p>

            <p n="13">13. <hi>Saul</hi> was convinced of his Sin, by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> dealing with him, and did Confeſs it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24, and at the laſt, without any Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>v.</hi> 30.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102526:23"/> reſpect (as well as all the other before named) did <hi>David</hi> far out-ſtrip <hi>Saul,</hi> as will afterwards be made evident.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finiſhed the firſt general Branch of <hi>Davids</hi> Commendation, <hi>viz.</hi> in a way of Comparing him with <hi>Saul;</hi> in which regard partly, he is here ſaid to have been a man after God's own heart, becauſe he was a Better man than <hi>Saul</hi> was, whether we do conſider <hi>David</hi> at his <hi>worſt,</hi> or <hi>Saul</hi> when at his <hi>beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which Diſcourſe, we may obſerve ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is of ſpecial Uſe, both in a way of Trial and Inſtruction, and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, in a way of Trial, we may hence learn, on the one hand, that if our Diſtempers be ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi>'s were, they will ſadly evidence againſt us, that we are not after God's own heart; and on the other hand, that we cannot ſafely judge our ſelves or others to be after Gods own heart, unleſs our Righteouſneſs doth exceed what was to be found in <hi>Saul;</hi> ſince <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is here thus witneſſed concerning, in a way of Diſtinguiſhing him from the other, in thoſe forementioned reſpects. I dare not ſay, that <hi>Saul</hi> went as far as a falſe heart can goe, or that he is a <hi>David</hi> who doth out-ſtrip <hi>Saul;</hi> but this I may dare to ſay, that he who is as Bad as <hi>Saul,</hi> or no whit Better, may groundedly conclude, he is not right. I would not Diſcourage any, who have the leaſt meaſure of Worth or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor is there any cauſe why ſuch ſhould be Diſcouraged, conſidering how richly <hi>Saul</hi>'s Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was rewarded: Onely let none Deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102526:23"/> by an over-valuation. Men may have <hi>Another Heart,</hi> and yet not <hi>David</hi>'s; they may be Obedient unto their Parents; Humble in their Carriage; able to command their Paſſion; courageous in a good Cauſe; much affected with God's goodneſs; ready to witneſs on a good man's behalf; they may conſult with God; be very zealous in the way of their Profeſſion; adventure themſelves much in a way of Duty; and be very righteous towards men; they may be no vicious Perſons, or groſs Idolaters; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear the ſaddeſt word from God; confeſs their ſin; deſire Forgiveneſs; and be content to part with a beloved Luſt; they may Love the Brethren; Acknowledge the evil of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perſecution; prefer them before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Doe good to others; and be very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Truths of God againſt the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of them; and yet for all this, may not be men after God's own heart. Thus far may a poor carnal Creature goe, and a great deal further, as might be proved (but that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subject will not bear that Enlargement) from the inſtance of that other <hi>Saul,</hi> untill he was converted, and had his Name changed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Nature, who whileſt he was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> was, <hi>as touching the Righteouſneſs which is in the Law, Blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3. 6.</p>
            <p>But what then ſhall we think of ſuch, who will fall in with worldly Temptations upon any tearms; who make their own Will their Law; who do preſumptuouſly tranſgreſs a known Command; who caſt off Prayer; who ſet up Duties of their own Deviſing; who put God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102526:24"/> off with the vile and refuſe, reſerving the Beſt unto themſelves; who Eat and wipe their mouth, and then ſay they have done no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who ſeek to cover their Diſcloſed ſin; who will moſt impudently deny what is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably proved; who will Extenuate at leaſt what can be no longer Denyed; whoſe Mind runs more upon their Carnal Intereſt, than either Gods glory, or their own Salvation; who are a Terrour to good men, and the Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of evil; who ſeek to play away their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Conſcience; who live in Envy againſt their Betters; who are moſt notorious Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; and will both Curſe and Lie; who Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute men after Gods own heart; who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with a Familiar Spirit; and who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acceſſary unto their own Deſtruction? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe men cannot be right, as to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, ſince they do ſo fully reſemble <hi>Saul</hi> when at his <hi>worſt,</hi> in a way of Diſtinction from whom (when at his Beſt) <hi>David</hi> is here ſaid to have been one after God's own heart. Indeed a <hi>Saul</hi> may become a <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore ſuch are encouraged unto the uſe of Converting Means; but an actual <hi>Saul</hi> is not a <hi>David,</hi> and therefore let not ſuch offer to deceive others or themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, we may hence learn, in a way of Inſtruction, what may be the Portion of a Carnal Profeſſor from the hand of God, in point of Good things; whileſt we conſider what <hi>Saul</hi> met with in that reſpect; who yet came far ſhort of <hi>David,</hi> in point of Priviledges as well as Duty. Which lower ſort of Priviledges were as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:102526:24"/> 1. <hi>Saul</hi> was Circumciſed; which <hi>Paul</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth among thoſe things wherein he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times truſted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 5; and which <hi>Saul</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at ſo high a rate, as that he would rather Kill himſelf, than be thruſt through by the hands of Uncircumciſed ones, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. Now that Circumciſion in the fleſh, was an outward Badge of ones being a Legal Saint, or of that Number who were then called an Holy Nation, <hi>Exo.</hi> 19. 6; and ſo it fitly anſwereth unto the Viſibility of Saintſhip in Goſpel-times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. And thus a meer carnal Creature may be accounted Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Such may have a Name to Live, who yet are Dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. A Fornicatour, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Perſon, an Idolater, a Railer, a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, may yet be called a Brother, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. And thoſe may call themſelves of the Holy City, or be called by the Name of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and Swear by the Name of God (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they profeſs themſelves to be his Servants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 53.) and yet not in Truth or Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 1, 2. Little do many think that they are workers of Iniquity, till Chriſt ſhall make it out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. Some one or other of thoſe bloody Souldiers that had crucified Chriſt, was yet ſeen afterwards to wear his ſeamleſs Coat or upper Garment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 23, 24. There is no inconſiſtency between the Inward Power of Sin, and an Outward Form of Godlineſs. Such as can ſatisfie themſelves with a bare Title of Chriſtianity, may have it conferr'd upon them in a way of Judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Saul</hi> was a Member of the onely true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church that then was in Being; by which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102526:25"/> means he did partake of thoſe Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which were denyed unto the Poſterity of circumciſed <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church and Ordinances, do fitly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto ſuch like Inſtitutions in Goſpel-times; which are ſome kind of choiſer and more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Priviledges, that are not vouchſafed unto all, who yet may be as it were circumciſed, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints; and therefore we read of ſome, who were <hi>added to the Lord,</hi> Act. 5. 14, who yet durſt not Joyn themſelves to that Church in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> v. 13, which then was the onely true viſible Goſpel-Church in being.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102526:25"/> 3, 4, 5. The Church in <hi>Corinth</hi> had one very Wicked Perſon in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13; and other Churches then had ſuch among them, whom <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed to have cut off, <hi>Cal.</hi> 5. 12; the Generality of that Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> had onely a Name to Live, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 1; and the whole Church in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was ſtark naught, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Saul</hi> was an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by Birth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1, and not onely by Religion, as Proſelytes were; which <hi>Paul</hi> hinteth as an Additional Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, when he ſaith, that he was <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> Phil. 3. 5, without any mixture of Gentiliſme in his Lineage.

Such may deſcend of godly Parents, which is no contemptible Mercy, ſince by that means they may ſhare in the benefit of their Prayers and Education, whereby the Lord is pleaſed many times to work the ſame unfeigned Faith in them, which firſt dwelt in their Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Such may be admitted into the Number and Fellowſhip of thoſe, who are not Polluted with any groſs Gentile intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who have been as it were Fathers in point of Faith and Duty; who have continued true unto their profeſſed Principles in the midſt of their manifold Temptations; and have not only eſpouſed Chriſts Truths and Wayes in a day of outward Proſperity, as the generality of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelytes were wont to doe. They may ſeem to be the Prime Owners of all the Saints Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, in point of Adoption, Glory, Covenants, Ordinances and Promiſes; and of Such may Chriſt's Diſpenſation come, as to its more Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Fleſhly part; the Goſpel of whoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Kingdom may be firſt Preached or Tendred unto them, who yet may not enter thereinto, through Unbelief; but may Oppoſe and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, to their own deſtruction, by reaſon of their Carnality.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Saul</hi> came of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1; which was another of thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

            <p n="6">6. After that <hi>Saul</hi> was Anointed and Choſen King, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſadly afflicted by their Enemies on every ſide. The <hi>Ammonites</hi> had affrighted ſeveral of them into an Offer of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull compliance with them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 1. and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were too many for them,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102526:40"/> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 5. having left the common People neither Sword nor Spear, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. nor Smith to make them any, <hi>ver.</hi> 19; who being by that means Diſtreſſed, did Hide themſelves, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and the Stouteſt of them Trembled, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſo as that their Enemies inſulted over them, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spoilers out of their Camp, in ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. Poor carnal People are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Diſappointed of their high expectations from Worldly conſtitutions; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, who looked for great matters to have been done by their National King. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſeeming Inward Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which ſome Profeſſors are inveſted with, typified by <hi>Sauls</hi> Supremacy; yet are they ſadly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver powered by Satans temptations and their own corruptions ſtill, which were Spiritually ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by <hi>Iſraels</hi> Adverſaries. Such may be made to think, that there is no way to get ſhut of Satan, but by their compliance with him in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome Leſſer ſins; which they could freely ſubmit unto, but that they ſee at length, this will not ſatisfie their Adverſary; as was the caſe of thoſe men of <hi>Jabeſh.</hi> Such alſo may be trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over, by many groſs <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Luſts, which may be far more in Number than all their <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Vertues; and by which means they may be Stripped of their beſt Defenſive and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive weapons, ſuch as a meer Naturall man might otherwiſe be furniſht with; ſo as that their hearts may generally fail them, whenever a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth appear, and thoſe Myſtical <hi>Philiſtines</hi> may ſend Spoilers among them what they pleaſe. As men would not expoſe themſelves to bee the

            <p n="7">7. When <hi>Saul</hi> conſulted with the Lord, what he ſhould do, in a caſe of great concernment, and according to Gods Appointment, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 21. yet God would not Anſwer him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 37. and at another time, when <hi>Saul</hi> was moſt afraid, and when his heart greatly trembled, he did En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God, but the Lord would not Anſwer him, neither by Dreams, nor by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> nor by <hi>Prophets,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 5, 6. which tempted him to conſult with that Witch, <hi>v.</hi> 15. unto his own deſtruction, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 13. The Lord was ſometimes pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf of old by Dreames, which were for the moſt part impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Holy Perſons, though ſometimes unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo; but <hi>Saul</hi> had no Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this way from any: But the more ordinary way of Gods Diſcovering his Mind was then by Prophets, who were Moſtly Holy Perſons alſo, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but <hi>Samuel</hi> was now dead, and that Spirit together with him, as to <hi>Sauls</hi> relief: But the Moſt ordinary way then was, by conſulting with the High Prieſt, being clad with <hi>Aarons</hi> Ephod, and Breaſt-plate, wherein was the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Exod. 28. 30. Num. 27. 21. Now <hi>Abiathar</hi> had formerly carried away this Ephod
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102526:41"/> to <hi>David</hi> when he fled from <hi>Sauls</hi> fury, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. ſo that he had at preſent no <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with through his own default; And when he did conſult therewith, the time before, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 37. it was meerly upon the Prieſts motion, and not his own deſire, <hi>v.</hi> 36. who but a little before, had ſeemed to Deſpiſe it, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and therefore had no cauſe to Wonder at Gods not anſwering him thereby, <hi>v.</hi> 37. Though alſo his laſt Enquiring of God, was in ſuch a ſorry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28, 6. as that he is elſewhere ſaid not to have Enquired of God at all, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 14. And thus, an Hypocrite may Pray, and Adviſe with the Lords moſt faithful Servants, (who were typified by thoſe Dreamers and Prophets and High Prieſts of old) and yet may not be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the account of his preſent State or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sleightineſs, and great Tranſgreſſion, as was the caſe of <hi>Saul;</hi> which is a very ſad diſpenſation, and that which may occaſion his conſulting with Carnal Policy at leaſt, which is no better than a Wizard; juſt as it hath lately befaln ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Profeſſors in our dayes. As men would have God to Hear them when at any time they ſeek unto him, ſo let them take heed of Reſting in <hi>Sauls</hi> condition; ſince God doth not Hear Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 31, nor any one that Regardeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 18.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Saul</hi> ſadly Miſtook what was the True and Proper cauſe of Gods not anſwering him that day 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 37. Preſuming that it was, becauſe his ſinfull Adjuration, <hi>v.</hi> 24. had not been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39. whereas he might eaſily have ſuſpected, that God was Offended, with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102526:42"/> Sleightineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and with his being meerly Paſſive in this preſent addreſs, which had not now been, if the Prieſt had not urged him thereunto, <hi>v.</hi> 36. and eſpecially with the Peoples eating Blood, which was the conſequent of his wicked curſe, <hi>v.</hi> 32. which he was told of, <hi>v.</hi> 33. and thought he had ſufficiently Expiated that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion by a future Reformation, <hi>v.</hi> 34. though by the Law ſuch Offenders ſhould have been cut off, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 27. And thus a carnal Profeſſor is apt to be very Groſly miſtaken, as to what is the Proper ground of ſuch a croſs Providence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to impute the Procuring cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto ſome other rather than himſelf; and not to ſee, what is the True and Manifeſt occaſion of Gods contending with him in ſuch a way; but to pitch upon a fancy, and in the mean while to overlook a Real and very great tranſgreſſion. Now this is a ſad diſpenſation, ſince if the Cauſe of a Suffering be thus miſtaken, a Soul knoweth not what courſe to take for its Removeall, but may do Harm inſtead of Good, as in the caſe of a Bodily diſtemper, when the right Humour is not his upon: and therefore in ſuch a caſe, <hi>David</hi> was ſo wiſe as to Enquire of God, what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. as <hi>Saul</hi> here ſhould have done, and whereupon he might poſſibly have been Reſolved, had he perſiſted therein, ſince it is here onely ſaid, that the Lord anſwered him not That Day, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 37. intimating as if his Perſeverance might have been crowned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But this is one part of a Natural mans dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full portion, that he is not able to Judge of Gods mind in his correcting Providences, through the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102526:42"/> prevalency of his Ignorance, Self-love and Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And let it be well obſerved, whether ſome in our dayes, have not brought that Miſery upon themſelves, by their ſuperſtitious Impoſitions, which they would think hath been the fruit of others non-complaynce therewith.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Lord did juſtly Harden <hi>Saul</hi> in his ſinfull practice and opinion, by ſuffering <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to be taken by that Lot which <hi>Saul</hi> caſt, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 14. 42; wherein the Lord was Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince <hi>Saul</hi> deſired, that God would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcover, who it was that had violated his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Adjuration, <hi>v.</hi> 41; and yet <hi>Saul</hi> was juſtly Hardned, ſince he by this means thought that <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s not complying with that unlawfull Prohibition, was the very Cauſe why God did not anſwer <hi>Saul, v.</hi> 37.

And thus, a Corrupt ſtate of things may be accompanyed with ſome ſucceſs, though Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the ſakes and by the hand of ſuch as <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were; but yet withall, that preſent ſucceſs may onely vexe the Adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who at the laſt may Overcome their ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time-Conquerours, eſpecially when <hi>David</hi> is become the Object of thoſe Conquerours Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and is more civilly dealt with by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> than by his own Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: all which hath eminently been Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in theſe latter dayes.

However, we may obſerve from hence, that an Hypocrite may little deſerve to be Deſired or Lamented, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his being Miſchievous unto others, whoſe Relations may ſadly ſuffer for his Miſcarriages. How apt are ſuch to hinder the ſlaughter of ſome <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Luſts, by their ſuperſtitious forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe lawfull and Neceſſary Helps, which the Lord hath not forbidden? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.

And how apt are ſuch, to create unto themſelves a ſad after-reckoning, by that which at the preſent they Blindly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be their Zeal and Duty. As men would not be liable to ſuch a portion, ſo let them take heed of Reſting in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Condition.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Saul</hi> was (by his Naughtineſs) the Cauſe of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Mourning, who had Anoynted him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 35; and by his Oppreſſion, he made them Crie, who had ſo Inordinately deſired him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 18; whom they ſoon grew weary of, and long'd for <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 17. And let it be obſerved, whether Worldly and National Conſtitutions (ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi>'s was) have not made thoſe to Crie out, who ſometimes would not be ſatisfied without them: and whether that men of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ſpirit, have not Mourned untill the day of their Death, for ſuch Things and Perſons, which they have been Inſtrumental unto the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of. However, we may hence learn, that a man not after God's own heart, is apt to be unto the great Grief of others, both Good and Bad. Chriſt's outward Sufferings indeed, were as a Sword piercing through his Mother's Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 35; but yet upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that Womb was Bleſt that bare him, and thoſe Paps that he had ſucked, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 27: whereas a fooliſh Son is the Calamity of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 13, and the Heavineſs of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 1; a Grief to his Father, and Bitterneſs to her that Bare him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 25. Such are apt to take thoſe Courſes, that may make their Relations and beſt Friends to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of them, and to wiſh for their Removal.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102526:45"/> Diſobedience to God, may juſtly ſtrip thoſe of that Reſpect and Love, which otherwiſe might be expected. He that liveth without being Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, may depart without being Deſired, as <hi>Jehoram</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 20; and which may be the Portion of any one who is not a man after Gods own heart.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Lord checked <hi>Samuel,</hi> becauſe of his Mourning ſo long for <hi>Saul,</hi> ſince he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him; and Wiped his Eye, by ſending him to Anoynt <hi>David</hi> in his ſtead, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. And this is another part of that ſad portion from the Lord, which is moſt likely to befall a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Hypocrite, and a Worldly Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; both which may Bitterly be Lamented by ſuch, who do behold their Evil, and foreſee their Downfall; nor can it be denyed to be a very great Priviledge, to ſhare in the benefit of a Good man's Prayer and Mourning: but yet when their Sorrow or Supplication relateth to ſuch things as theſe, it may be ſo far from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with God, as that he may bid his People to Pray and Mourn no more, and divert the Current of their Affections into ſome other Channel. Hath not this been fulfilled already, in relation to thoſe Worldly Forms, which ſome good men have formerly endeavoured to keep up with their Prayers and Tears? Hath not the Lord Rebuked them for ſo doing, and given them to underſtand, that he hath Rejected them, notwithſtanding what hand himſelf had in their Erecting? Hath he not enclined the Hearts of his <hi>Samuels,</hi> to go ſeek up <hi>David,</hi> although with the hazard of their Lives, from <hi>Saul</hi>'s hand?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102526:45"/> However, we may hence learn, that a man not after Gods own heart, may ſoon ceaſe to be the object of a Saints Remembrance. He that will not be guided by their counſel, may juſtly be thruſt out of their Prayer. God can Silence any of his Speakers when he pleaſeth; and if a People or Perſon will not Anſwer to Gods call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 13, the next news is, <hi>Pray not for ſuch, v.</hi> 16; which Word is as the Sentence before Execution: and as poor creatures would not come under it, ſo let them take heed of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in <hi>Sauls</hi> condition.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102526:51"/> was) be not alſo untimely Taken away by the hand of ſome groſſer Intereſt, as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's anſwerable Wrath. But above all the reſt, <hi>Saul</hi> died Deſperately; not Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, but of one that had a Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 13, 14, a very little before his death, who then Worſhipped the Devil in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> likeneſs, being ſo far Deluded, as to think that this was <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 14; by whom his unavoidable deſtruction was foretold, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19; and whereunto himſelf was Acceſſary, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4: Now this is an evident Sign of God's Wrath, when a Soul dies Deſperately, conſulting with the Devil inſtead of God, and being wilfully Active unto the ſhortning of that Life which might have been Prolonged; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof, upon a <hi>Saul-</hi>like Spirit or ſtate of things in theſe laſt dayes, ought wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be obſerved and improved. But this is another Branch of that miſery which a Natural man is ſubject unto, to be taken away in Gods Wrath; which muſt needs be very ſad, ſince Man's wrath is cruel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 4. and then much more God's; the ſenſe whereof made the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt diſtracted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 15, 16; and which if kindled but a little, is enough to make men Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12; eſpecially when it relateth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man's being Taken away therein, which cutteth off all hopes of future mercy.</p>
            <p>From all which ſeveral Branches, of what may poſſibly befall a Natural man, let every one take heed of Abiding in ſuch a ſad ſtate; as they would not have their Mercies to be given in Anger; as they would not have them to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;

               <hi>David</hi>'s Deſcription; viz. <hi>As he was in himſelf conſidered.</hi> Which is of ſingular Uſe to be enquired into, as we would know, when either a Particular Perſon, or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick State of Things, is after God's own heart: ſince <hi>David</hi>'s Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on was a clear Type of a true Believer; and ſince his Diſpenſation did alſo ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie, a glorious State of things in Goſpel-times, which at the firſt was meerly Spiritual, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1. 32, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 16; but is to be at laſt made good in a Temporal reſpect alſo, Ultimately when Chriſt ſhall come in Perſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 16, and Dwell in that <hi>New Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21. 2, 3, which was ſhadowed out by <hi>David</hi>'s City; and before that time, at the <hi>Jews</hi> Converſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 9. &amp; 23. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 7. &amp; 16. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 23. &amp; 37. 24; all whoſe Promiſes muſt firſt be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed upon us Gentiles, that ſo through our Mercy they alſo may obtain Mercy, <hi>Romans</hi> 11. 31.</p>
            <p>Now this Deſcription of <hi>David,</hi> as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſidered, is <hi>partly</hi> to be had out of the Hiſtory of his Life; but more Epecially out of his Book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> VVhich Book of Pſalms doth ſeem generally to have been compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> although that the greater part of thoſe Pſalms hath not his Name Prefixed to them; which yet is no Argument to Prove that they are not his, ſince the Second Pſalm hath no ſuch Title, which yet is expreſſely ſaid to have been <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 25; ſo alſo the Ninety Fifth Pſalm, <hi>v.</hi> 7, compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 7; and the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102526:53"/> Hundred and fifth Pſalm (the former part) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7, 8. Nor can it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be concluded, that any of thoſe Pſalms were Penned by <hi>Heman, Ethan, Jeduthun,</hi> or <hi>Aſaph,</hi> ſince by the ſame reaſon we may conceive that the Sons of <hi>Korah</hi> did joyntly compoſe ſome other of them, which may not be ſuppoſed; eſpecially ſince thoſe before named are onely called <hi>Singers,</hi> 1 Chr. 15. 19, or ſuch as did fit the Pſalms with Tunes; though poſſibly <hi>Aſaph</hi> might have compoſed ſome other ſpiritual Songs, which were made uſe of in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30. But <hi>David</hi> is Peculiarly called the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1, in relation to his being the Penman of what the Scripture calleth <hi>Pſalms,</hi> who therefore doth ſeem to be acknowledged by Chriſt himſelf as the Author of that Book, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 42. So that I think we may ſafely conceive, that the Generality of thoſe Pſalms are <hi>Davids,</hi> unleſs it be evident unto the contrary, either from the Title (as in the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Pſalm) or from ſome Expreſſions therein, inconſiſtent with <hi>David</hi>'s time; which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concluded, meerly from what was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically written; ſince <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83, was penn'd in <hi>Aſaph</hi>'s time, who lived in the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6. 39; and ſo that Pſalm and ſuch like, might be compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> although they relate to After-times. Though I ſhall Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground my following Diſcourſe, upon what is regiſtred in thoſe Pſalms, concerning whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour there is the leaſt Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi> (as in himſelf conſidered) is thus Abſolutely Deſcribed in the Scriptures, Partly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102526:53"/> by his more Inward frame, or by ſome more General Qualification relating to his whole Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and Partly, by that more Outward and Particular Proof or Demonſtration that he gave, of his being a Man after God's own Heart.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution whereof, it will be worth obſerving, how fully <hi>Paul</hi> doth reſemble <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> according to what is recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning both. Which <hi>Paul</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Saul,</hi> both as to his Name and Nature, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 2; but afterwards he became a <hi>David, v.</hi> 15; as an encouragement unto men of <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſpirit, to wait upon God in the diligent uſe of Soul-converting Means. And as <hi>David</hi> was the moſt Eminent in his Time for cloſe walking with God, ſo alſo was <hi>Paul,</hi> among thoſe with whom he lived. And as <hi>David</hi> was a Standard to his Succeſſours in point of Priviledge and Duty ſo alſo was <hi>Paul</hi> a Pattern to them which ſhould Believe hereafter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. So that there ſeemeth to be ſomething of the Divine Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Parallel between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> which therefore ought ſo much the more to be regarded by us.</p>
            <p>Now the Firſt comprehenſive Branch of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Abſolute Deſcription, conſiſteth in his more Inward Frame, or in thoſe general Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which related to his <hi>whole</hi> Obedience which made his Duty Eminent, and evidenced him to be a man after God's own heart. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi>'s Obedience was Sincere. His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was, to walk with a perfect heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2; and he was Upright before the Lord,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102526:54"/> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23; in which reſpect, God witneſſed on his behalf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 3, who had proved him, and viſited him in the Night, and found him to be as he appeared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 3. His pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did not goe out of feigned Lips <hi>pſal.</hi> 17. 1, but was the work of his Soul as well as Body, <hi>pſal.</hi> 86. 4, and was performed with his whole heart, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 10. He alſo praiſed God with Uprightneſs of heart, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 7; with his Soul and all that was within him, <hi>pſ.</hi> 103. 1; with <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was for Love without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9; having renounced the Hidden things of Diſhoneſty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2; and ſpeaking as in the ſight of God in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17; and ſerving him with his Spirit, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1. 9; which Converſation of his in Simplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sincerity was the matter of his rejoycing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, muſt needs be Upright, ſince God himſelf is ſo, <hi>pſa</hi> 25 8, who deſireth Truth in the Inward parts, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 6. A gracious heart is ſincere in his dealings with God and Man. An Hypocrite is the worſt of Sinners, but Perſons truely Juſtified are ſuch in whoſe Spirit there is no Guile, <hi>pſa.</hi> 32. 2. Let this be duely weighed by them whoſe words are ſmoother than Oyl, whileſt warre is in their hearts; and who can counterfeit much Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>prayer,</hi> for that Light and Grace, which in their hearts they do Deſpiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Davids</hi> Obedience was Univerſal. All the Statutes of God were before him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 18. 22;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102526:54"/> and otherwiſe he ſhould have been aſhamed, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 6. He deſired of God, that he would not let Any iniquity have dominion over him, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119, 133; and he refrained his feet from Every evil way, <hi>v.</hi> 101, and hated Every falſe way, <hi>v.</hi> 104.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, had lived in All good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God untill that day, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1; making it his conſtant exerciſe to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence toward God and Man, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16: who ſtirred up others to abound in Every grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7; and to be filled with the fruits of Righteousneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 11; being fruitfull in Every good work, unto All well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>A truely gracious heart is Chriſts own Image, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10; from whoſe fulneſs he receiveth, <hi>and grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. True grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in an holy Diſpoſition, to Do whatever God requireth, and to avoid the contrary. He that cheriſheth the leaſt known ſin, or that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the careleſs neglect of any known Duty, hath a very bad evidence of his being a man after Gods own heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi>'s Obedience was very Generous, as was evidenced ſeveral wayes. He would not Offer unto the Lord his God, of that which did coſt him Nothing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. Nor was he Niggardly in point of Duty, but Abundant; ſacrificeing oxen and fatlings when the <hi>Ark</hi> had gone but Six paces. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 13; praying unto the Lord three times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17, and praiſing him ſeven times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102526:55"/> Talents of Gold, a thouſand thouſand Talents of Silver, and of Braſs and Iron without weight, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 14. Nor was he Preſſed into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſervice of God, but Voluntary; Freely ſacrificeing to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54. 6; Chuſeing the way of Truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30; and beſeeching an acceptance of his Freewill-offering, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 108.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſatifie himſelf with that Duty which coſt him Nothing, or which was not accompanied with the Croſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as others could, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. Nor was he a ſpiritual Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but in Labours more <hi>Abunaant,</hi> and in Priſons more <hi>Frequent,</hi> than his competitors, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. And as he did put others upon doing ſervice with Good will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 7; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo himſelf could not be Diſſwaded from that duty which was accompanied with greateſt Danger, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 13; and was gladly ſpent for thoſe, from whom he had not ſo much as Love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart knoweth how great a King God is, who therefore ſerved him with the beſt Male he hath, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. He is intereſted in Rich forgiving love, and therefore muſt needs love much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. Obedience is connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſuch a one, and therefore it muſt needs be very Voluntary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Davids</hi> Obedience was performed with much Earneſtneſs of Spirit and affection. He prepared for the Houſe of his God with all his Might, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 2. His Soul did Break for the Longing that it had unto God's Laws or Judgements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. And in relation to that Duty of Prayer, he did not onely Wiſh for what he would have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 6, but he alſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102526:55"/> Sought the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 4; and Thirſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 2; whom his Soul did follow Hard after, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 8; and unto whom his Soul was Lifted up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1; Crying unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61. 1; and groaning before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 9. and roaring, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. with Tears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 12. watering his couch therewith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 6; and making them his Meat both in the Day and Night <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 3.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> was for ſerving the Lord with ſpiritual or Inward Fervour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11; which he himſelf was wont to do with many tears, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 19; warning every one with Tears both night and day, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 31; writeing with many Tears and much Anguiſh of heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other's ſins with Weeping, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart is Lively, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what was typified by thoſe Inwards, which <hi>Moſes</hi> bad ſhould be offered up by Fire, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 9. Gods children are not aſhamed to Weep before him, although the Serpent's Seed Hiſs at it, as if it were Effeminate. Such are willing to exerciſe their Affections in his ſervice, from whom they have received them. And therefore they Weep not ſo much (as others do) upon the Creatures with-drawing or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to outward Sufferings, becauſe their Tears are laid out for God and in the diſcharge of their Active duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Davids</hi> Obedience was very Quick and Speedy. He was for Running in the way of Gods commands. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32; which he made Haſte and Delayed not to keep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 60. When God ſaid, ſeek ye my face; his heart
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102526:56"/> immediately replied, <hi>thy face Lord will I ſeek,</hi> Pſal. 27. 8. Nay, ſo ſoon as he did but read what God had writ concerning him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially underſtood that ſome further Duty was required, becauſe the Lord was not ſatisfied with Ordinary Sacrifices; he Preſently then ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> Pſal. 40. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7; and did not Tarry, (as ſluggiſh Profeſſors uſe to do) untill he had ſome Louder Call.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo ſoon as the Lord had ſent him to preach unto the Gentiles, although he foreknew that this would prove a tedious piece of work, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 15, 16, yet he Immediatly conferred not with fleſh and blood, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. 16. And when ſome would have Legally impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Believing Gentiles, <hi>Paul</hi> did not give place by ſubjection no not for an hour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5. He would not that the Sun ſhould go down upon mens wrath, nor that they ſhould give place unto the Devil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26, 27; but was for mens hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's Voice to Day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, for fear of being hardened, <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart, is nothing elſe but an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Eccho, unto a Divine command. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Elementary to ſuch a one, who therefore onely waiteth for a word of Order, to give him the Title of being Dutifull, and the Honour of Acceptance. He very well knoweth, that God loveth a Chearfull giver, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7; and that he diſliketh Dulneſs, by his forbidding <hi>Iſrael</hi> to feed upon the ſluggiſh Snail, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 30; and by commanding, that the firſtling of an Aſs ſhould either be Redeemed, or that they ſhould break his neck, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 20; to ſignifie, that he was

            <p>A gracious Heart dares not reſolve the VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his actions, into their own apprehended or real Uſefullneſs (at leaſtwiſe in matters of an Inſtituted nature) ſave as they have ſome foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from the Word of God.

            <p>A gracious heart accounteth his Duty to be a Recreation; and anſwereth as Chearfully unto that call, as if he were bid to eat or drink. He knoweth that God doth not love Sadneſs in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifice, by his forbidding Leaven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. 11: and that he loveth Chearfulneſs at ſuch a time, by his requiring Wine and Oil; <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 40.; the former of which doth conſtitute its Reality, and the latter its Viſibility, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>David</hi>'s obedience was performed with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and holy Fear. He knew that God's

            <p>Thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> was for the Exerciſe of that Grace, whereby he might ſerve God acceptably, with Reverence and Godly Fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28.

            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> deſired, that he might not be <hi>weary</hi> in well-doing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9; but that he and others might Ever follow that which is good, <hi>Rejoycing</hi> Evermore, <hi>praying</hi> without ceaſing, and in Every thing <hi>giving Thanks,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 15, 16, 17, 18; Continuing in <hi>prayer,</hi> Col. 4. 2; and <hi>watching</hi> thereunto with <hi>All perſeverance,</hi> Eph. 6. 18.</p>
            <p>A truely gracious heart muſt needs <hi>perſevere;</hi> becauſe he partaketh of that <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4, which is Unchangeable, <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. 6. He is bleſs'd with <hi>all</hi> ſpiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, among which Perſeverance cannot be denyed to be one.

            <p n="11">11. <hi>David</hi>'s Obedience proceeded from an <hi>Inward principle,</hi> and not onely from External Influences. God's Law was <hi>within his Heart,</hi> or in the <hi>Midſt of his Bowel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So alſo, the Lord was pleaſed to Reveal his Son In <hi>Paul,</hi> and not onely Unto him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16; and by him to Engrave in like manner, not in Tables of Stone, as under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>A gracious Heart is not <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in his Duty; nor is he acted by Outward Impulſives onely; but is furniſhed with an Inward Spring or Treaſury of holy Actions, from whence he bringeth forth things both New and Old, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 52. The Hope of a Reward and the Fear of Suffering, are as a Wind upon his Back, which forwardeth his progreſs Heavenward, but yet he is predominantly influenced by an Inward Principle of Life, which keepeth up his Spiritual Motion when thoſe Winds are down, and which helpeth him ſometimes to move <hi>againſt</hi> them. Thence is it that his ſpiritual Life is Hid, not being obvious unto a carnal Eye, as all Outward Motives are. Thence is it, that he can flie (like a living Bird) in a Calm of outward Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and not onely whileſt that Wind is up, as every Lighter thing can doe. Thence is it, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102526:60"/> if need be, he goes <hi>alone,</hi> not being carried (as many are) in others Arms. He Naturally moveth Upwards, as a Stone doth Downwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being violently caſt that way; nay though his Motion doth prove unto the breaking of his outward Intereſt in pieces. True Grace is a New Nature, which never will Compound againſt it ſelf; nor needeth to be Hired, any more than <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mother did, to become his Nurſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>David</hi>'s Obedience turned upon two golden Hinges; <hi>viz.</hi> with reſpect unto God's <hi>Command,</hi> as being that from whence it did Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and with reference to God's Glory, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that principal End which he Aimed at. God had Commanded him to keep his Precepts dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and Therefore did he deſire that his wayes might accordingly be directed, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 4, 5. He calleth God his Glory, <hi>pſa.</hi> 3. 3, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God's Glory was his higheſt Aim; who therefore begged for Deliverance, <hi>pſa.</hi> 9. 13, not ſo much that himſelf might be at quiet, as that he might ſhew forth God's Praiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 14; and that he might Live, to keep his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 17.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth unto Sanctification, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 3, and giving Thanks, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 18, Becauſe this is the Will of God: Who biddeth alſo, that we ſhould do all things to his Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31; as himſelf deſired that others might do no Evil, Not that he might thereby appear approved; but that they might do what is Honeſt, though he were Diſeſteemed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:102526:61"/>
            <p> The Duty of a gracious Heart, is Properly ſuch, and not Miſcalled; as that is, that is not performed in Obedience unto God's Command. And therefore it is partly, that ſuch a one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevereth, becauſe the Command continueth, when all other Motives fail, ariſing from Self-intereſt. A gracious heart is alſo taught of God, to be <hi>Active</hi> in the purſuance of his Glory; and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to think upon his Name, in all his Deſires and Actions, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. 16. He ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth God by his thus doing, and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be honoured by him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. He counteth himſelf to be Glorified, (as Chriſt did) if God be but Glorified in him; whom God will then Glorifie in himſelf, and ſtraightway glorifie him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 31, 32. He knoweth that a Selviſh Aim is enough to ſpoyl the beſt Act that is; as in <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Caſe, who had a clear Commiſſion for what he did againſt <hi>Ahab</hi>'s houſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 30, which yet his Squint-eye did turn into Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>David</hi>'s Obedience proceeded from an Evangelical Spirit of Faith, and from a Renewed ſpiritual Principle. That he was endowed with an Evangelical Spirit of Faith, is evident from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Gloſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13, upon <hi>David</hi>'s words, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 116. 10. And that he was furniſhed with a Principle both Spiritual and Renewed, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from his own Deſire, of being upheld with Gods free Spirit, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 12, and of having a Right Spirit renewed within him, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> was for the Obedience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5, as the Greek there is; or for that Obedience which is the fruit of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi>

And partly, becauſe this New Spiritual Principle is moſt Nobly Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; as may be thus made out. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs doth bring down Sin, but <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality</hi> is that which bringeth down, not onely the Sinfulneſs of Nature, but it's very Goodneſs alſo; now that which doth lay proud Nature's Honour moſt fully in the Duſt, muſt needs be the moſt Noble Operation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Spirituality doth indiſpenſably depend upon Chriſt for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſpiritual Influences unto the preſervation of its Being, as the Natural Branch doth upon the Oak, becauſe it hath no other Root; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Natural Goodneſs doth not Abſolutely depend upon any kind of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Influences from Chriſt (no more than the Ivy doth upon the Oak) for the preſervation of its Life and Being, but onely for it's Flouriſhing, or Better being; becauſe it hath (as hath the Ivy alſo) a Root of its own, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Remainder, which doth

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102526:64"/> Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will ſerve his own turn, and then Holding the reſt in Unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18; as the Ivy will not out-ſtrip its Kind, although there may be ſome Gradual difference.

            <p>Theſe things the Natural man <hi>receiveth</hi> not, <hi>for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he that is Spiritual judgeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14, 15.

Concerning Riches he ſaith, that <hi>ſurely every man walketh in a vain ſhew,</hi> and <hi>is diſquieted in vain,</hi> who <hi>heapeth up Riches, and knoweth not who ſhall gather them,</hi> Pſa. 39. 6; for <hi>when he Dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away, his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him,</hi> Pſa. 49. 17.

            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that the <hi>Faſhion of this World paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31: that Riches are <hi>uncertain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17; that there is no Confidence to be put in <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3. 3: and that it is <hi>appointed unto Men once to Die,</hi> Heb. 9. 27; in which regard, he calleth the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Mortal,</hi> Rom. 6. 12, an <hi>earthly Tabernacle,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1, and <hi>Vile,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart can See unto the World's End. He doth not Deſpiſe the Creature, nor doth he Idolize it. He knoweth it ſo well as that he dares not <hi>abuſe</hi> it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31; or <hi>truſt</hi> in it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, nor is he <hi>afraid</hi> when the Glory of another's Houſe is much encreaſed, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 49. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning the <hi>Souls worth;</hi> calling it his <hi>Darling,</hi> Pſa. 22. 20. &amp; 35. 17, about the <hi>Keeping</hi> whereof he was moſt ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 20; and whoſe Redemption was too Precious for any to accompliſh by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Riches, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 49. 6, 7, 8. Which though it may there Primarily relate unto this Natural Life, yet doth it Eminently import the Invaluable worth of Men's Souls preciſely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> Teſtifieth at an high rate concerning the Worth of Man's Life and Soul. He did ſo Prize this Natural Life, as that he would willingly have been Changed, without being uncloathed of his Earthly Tabernacle, though Burdenſome, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4: and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a great Mercy that the Sickneſs of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102526:68"/> was not unto Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 27. But as to the Soul ſtrictly taken, he hinteth how Dear it was, by making his willingneſs to have imparted it, the higheſt Pledge of his Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 8; accounting it the chiefeſt Object of a Goſpel-Officers watchfull care, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17; and the Principal Subject of Eternal Happineſs or Miſery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart is well acquainted with the Worth and Value both of his Life and Soul. He knoweth that this Natural Life is the choiſeſt of Outward Mercies, <hi>Job.</hi> 2. 4; and therefore he dares not ſin againſt his Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18, or ſinfully Neglect it, in a careleſs or ſuperſtitious way, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23; and therefore his readineſs to Die for Chriſt, is ſo much the more Noble Act. But yet he preferreth his Soul before his Body, chooſing rather to <hi>die</hi> than <hi>ſin, Matt.</hi> 26. 35; reſerving his Soul-love for Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7; and not fearing Man ſo much as God, becauſe Man can onely kill the Body, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning the Nature of holy Communion in a way of Brotherly Love, which he affirmeth to be very Pleaſant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1; to be accompanyed with a ſpecial Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 3; and to be fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by <hi>Aarons</hi> Oyntment, <hi>v.</hi> 2, and by Mount <hi>Hermon</hi>'s Dew, <hi>v.</hi> 3. The Communion of Saints, reſembleth Oyntment, in the Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of its manifold and precious Virtue; but yet it is like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Oyntment, which might not be converted unto a Prophane or Common

            <p>And thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that Chriſtian-Love is that more Excellent way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31; as being that One thing which doth <hi>fulfill</hi> the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9; and the Greateſt of all Abiding Graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13: who therefore ſtirreth up others to Keep this Spiritual Unity in the Bond of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3; Beſeeching them to Agree, by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10; if they had any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1, 2; Wondring how they Durſt doe otherwiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1; bidding to <hi>mark</hi> them who cauſed Diviſions, <hi>Ro.</hi> 16. 17, and wiſhing that they were <hi>cut off,</hi> Gal 5. 12.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart knoweth, that Chriſtian-Love is a Fructifying Dew upon thoſe of a Lowly and Humble ſpirit; but that it is a work of Gods own creating alſo. He knoweth that this Oyntment is of a Self-ſpreading Nature among the Royal Prieſthood, or Goſpel-Saints; but yet he dare not put this Sacred Oyl upon Common Perſons, or be an intimate Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any but ſuch as fear the Lord. But ſo far forth as men are commendably Brethren, he counteth it a Good and Pleaſant thing, that they ſhould dwell together in Unity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning the Uſefulneſs

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> counteth Sufferings for Chriſt, to be a Gift, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29; which fall out unto the Furtherance of the Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Who alſo ſaith, that the Saints are <hi>chaſtened of the Lord,</hi> that ſo they <hi>might not be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32: wherein the Lord dealeth with them as with <hi>Sons,</hi> Heb. 12. 7, that they might be partakers of his Holineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 10, and taſte of the Peaceable fruit of Righteouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 11; in which reſpects, ſuch Diſpenſations ought not to be Deſpiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 5.

But then Secondly, <hi>David</hi> doth here foretell his Downfall, which when it doth once Begin, it will Haſten apace, <hi>v.</hi> 3, and that it will End in his being <hi>deſtroyed for Ever,</hi> v. 5; who ſhall be turned into Hell, <hi>v.</hi> 17, as having forgotten God, and himſelf alſo to be but a Man, which he ſhall be <hi>minded</hi> of by his being put in Fear, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Whoſe Deſtruction will be by a Marvellous Appearance of God's own Preſence, <hi>v.</hi> 3; who will be then Known by his Judgement executed, and by Enſnaring this Party in their own work, <hi>v.</hi> 16, and <hi>taking</hi> them in their own Net, <hi>v.</hi> 15. And then theſe men ſhall be declared to be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and Wicked, <hi>v.</hi> 5, whatever they have formerly been accounted. But about that time the Saints will be brought to the very Gates of Death, <hi>v.</hi> 13; who yet ſhall then Truſt in God's Name, <hi>v.</hi> 10; and Pray unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 19; and humbly Expect, <hi>v.</hi> 18; whom the Lord

            <p>A man after God own heart, will dare to ſtyle the Man of Sin and all his Party, wicked Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, whatever flattering Titles others give them.

Fourthly, This Sion was originally the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> Fort, not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered till <hi>David's</hi> time, who was a Type of Chriſt, and more eſpecially with reference unto that time when his Temporal Kingdom ſhall be firſt ſet up. And ſuch are the choiſeſt Saints by Nature, who are originally <hi>Canaanites, Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, or the children of God's wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. as <hi>Canaan</hi> was of <hi>Noahs</hi> curſe, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9. 25; ſtrongly poſſeſt and fortified, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, till Chriſt reduce them, who loves to purchaſe with his Blood and Sword. God's deareſt Son muſt at the firſt be called out of <hi>Egypt, Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15, that ſo no fleſh might glory in his preſence. Nor will this Conqueſt be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, until Chriſts Temporal Kingdom ſhall viſibly appear. Fifthly, <hi>David</hi> tells us, that God was peculiarly the God of Sion, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 146. 10. And this is the Priviledge of all true Goſpel-Saints, that God is peculiarly Theirs, as they are His; in which regard, not onely doth <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (an Heathen) call him the God of <hi>Daniel, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> 6. 20; but <hi>Saul</hi> alſo (a common <hi>Iſraelite)</hi> doth call him <hi>Samuel's</hi> God, in a way of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 15. And though others may have the Boldneſs to call God Theirs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 54; yet none have any lawful <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> to doe ſo, ſave ſuch as truly doe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Sixthly, <hi>David</hi> tells us, that Sion was the place where God did Manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Greateſt Glory, from whence he ſhone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 2; and before whom his People did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 7; and where he did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his Greatneſs, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ.</hi> 99. 2. And thus, Chriſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102526:88"/> Manifeſteth himſelf unto his true Diſciples, and not unto the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 22; who have a Promiſe of his peculiar Preſence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20; and God is in Them of a truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. Seventhly, He telleth us, that in Sion the Lord would make <hi>David's</hi> Horn to Bud, and that he had There ordained a Lamp for his <hi>Annointed, pſ.</hi> 132. 13. 17; which <hi>Zacharias</hi> doth Myſtically interpret, and with reference unto Chriſt's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Goſpel-times, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 69. And thus, as Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom was firſt ſet up among theſe ſons of Sion; ſo alſo, his temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall firſt put forth or Bud, among his choiſeſt Saints and Churches; who will not there want a Succeſſour, as that word Lamp importeth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 4. Eighthly, he tells us, that <hi>Sion</hi> was the Place of moſt Prevailing Prayer, as alſo of moſt abundant and acceptable Praiſes. Others are ſlow in returning Thanks for what Mercies they have received, if ever they doe perform what they have ſometimes Vowed; but Praiſe waiteth for God in <hi>Sion,</hi> and unto him ſhall the vow there be performed, <hi>pſ.</hi> 65. 1. there alſo Brake he the arrows of the bow the ſhield and ſword, <hi>viz.</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Sion's</hi> Prayer, <hi>pſ.</hi> 76. 3. in which regard ſhe is ſaid to be more glorious and excellent than the mountains of Prey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her effecting that by Prayer, which others could not do by force of Arms, <hi>v.</hi> 4 5, 6. And thus, the choiſeſt Saints are moſt powerful with God in Prayer, and moſt ready to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whoſe Praiſes are alſo beſt accepted, whilſt the Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. Ninthly, He tells us that as well the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102526:88"/> Singers as the Players upon Inſtruments ſhall be in Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 7. And thus, true Goſpel-Saints have both the Form and Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or they do both <hi>profeſs</hi> and <hi>practiſe;</hi> and they ſhall be fully furniſhed with all manner of Gifts and Graces; nor doth their Excellency conſiſt in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> onely, (as did the <hi>Phariſees, Matt.</hi> 23. 3, 4.) but theſe are good at <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi> alſo; and they ſhall daily more and more encreaſe, in the Joint Knowledge and Practice of all Truths and Duties, both Old and New, the former of which doth fitly anſwer to Ancient Singing, as the latter doth unto that later Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Appointment of Playing upon Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which never was added unto the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Worſhip and Service of God till <hi>David</hi>'s time. Common <hi>Iſraelites</hi> will own, whatever Truth or Duty is evident by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thoſe Inſtitutions which have been <hi>practiſed</hi> and <hi>known</hi> of Old; but a true Son of <hi>Sion</hi> will Adde unto theſe things, whatever Chriſt would have Added, although it hath not been in uſe <hi>before.</hi> At the Gates of a right Spouſe are all manner of pleaſant Fruits, New and Old, which ſhe hath laid up for her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 13. Tenthly, He tells us, that the Lord will abundantly Bleſs <hi>Sion</hi>'s <hi>Proviſion,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfie her Poor with Bread,</hi> and <hi>cloath her Prieſts with Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 132. 15, 16: all which ſhall one day be fulfilled in the Letter, and in relation to Outward Enjoyments, when the High-Prieſts or Eminenteſt Profeſſors, ſhall Inherit the Earth as well as Heaven; but in the mean time, and in a Spiritual ſence, the Beſt Saints are diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102526:89"/> from others, by that Bleſſing which doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their Proviſion, which maketh their Souls to Thrive in every Condition and under every kind of Diſpenſation; nay and the Pooreſt of them are comfortably ſatisfied with Bread, ſo as to prevent their being <hi>ſpiritually</hi> ſtarved; and the Chief Prieſts among them are Cloathed with Salvation, or with that rich Grace, which doth as Viſibly Adorn them, as a comely Garment doth him that weareth it, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 14. Eleventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he tells us, that <hi>Sion</hi> muſt needs be very ſafe, whoſe Towers and Bulwarks he biddeth all to Mark and Number, that they might tell it to the Generations following, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 48. 12, 13; in whoſe Pallaces God is known for a Refuge, <hi>v.</hi> 3; and whom the Higheſt himſelf hath promiſed to Eſtabliſh, <hi>pſa.</hi> 87. 5, for Ever, <hi>pſa.</hi> 48. 8; in which regard the Greateſt of thoſe that come againſt her, are Aſtoniſht at the Sight of her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnableneſs, whereupon they <hi>paſs</hi> by together, and not without ſome Haſte and Trouble, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. And thus, as the Mountains are round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo is the Lord about his People, <hi>pſa.</hi> 125. 2; who will be their God for Ever, and their Guide even unto Death, <hi>pſa.</hi> 48. 14. Twelfthly, He tells us, that <hi>Glorious things</hi> are ſpoken of <hi>Sion;</hi> and that God will make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rahab</hi> (or <hi>Egypt)</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> to them that Know him, <hi>This man was Born there;</hi> and of <hi>Sion</hi> it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>This and That man was Born in Her;</hi> and that <hi>the Lord ſhall count</hi> (when he writeth up the People) <hi>that This man was born There,</hi> Pſa. 87. 3, 4, 5, 6: To ſignifie, <hi>partly,</hi> that it is a great Honour unto that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102526:89"/> who had his firſt Beginning under <hi>Sion</hi>'s Diſpenſation; as it is a Reproach to him (among them that Know God,) whoſe Original was in Spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that as <hi>Rahab, Babylon, Philiſtia, Tire</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> have ſometimes Boaſted of their Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and famous Men; ſo <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall alſo be able to Produce her Men of Renown, and Two to the other's One. And thus, it is a precious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have been Born (whether Naturally or Spiritually) under a Purer Diſpenſation; as on the other ſide, it is enough to Blemiſh his beſt Perfections, who is polluted with an <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Birth: And though the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Party have hitherto had the Name for Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, yet have the Pureſt Worſhippers alway been Really their Equals, and ſhall at laſt Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip them, in all manner of truely Glorious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, whether Naturall or Morall. Thirteenthly, He tells us, that all Gods <hi>Springs</hi> (as the Beſt Expoſitors carry it,) are in this <hi>Sion, pſa.</hi> 87. 7. And thus, Goſpel-Saints and Churches, are better watered than any other; out of whoſe Belly do flow Rivers of Living water, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38; who have the moſt Freſh and Durable and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Influences; whoſe Leaf and Fruit ſhall therefore Never fail, <hi>pſa.</hi> 1. 3, and from whom theſe waters are communicated unto others. If every one had their Right, the pureſt Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in all Ages, will be found to have been the Well-head of all thoſe Choiſer Scriptural Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which others have Borrowed of them. Fourteenthly, He tells us, that <hi>Sion</hi> is God's Dwelling-place, <hi>pſa.</hi> 76. 2; the <hi>City</hi> of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102526:90"/> 
               <hi>Great King,</hi> Pſal. 48. 2; which he hath Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his Habitation, ſaying, <hi>This is my Reſt for Ever, here will I Dwell for I have Deſired it,</hi> Pſal. 132. 13, 14. And thus the Lord may have Tabernacled for a While, among thoſe of a <hi>lower Spirit</hi> and <hi>Principle;</hi> but the Place of his ſettled Reſidence hath been among ſuch Churches and Profeſſors who were moſt Powerfull and Pure. His Foundation is in theſe Holy Mountains, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 87. 1, which therefore cannot be Removed, <hi>pſ.</hi> 125. 1; Himſelf hath Built them, and therefore the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 18; and he hath built them an Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22, and therefore Woe be to thoſe that ſay, <hi>Let us take to our ſelves the Houſes of God in poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſa. 83. 9, 10, 11, 12: <hi>whoſe Houſe are we, if we Hold faſt the Confidence, and the rejoycing of the Hope firm unto the End,</hi> Heb. 3. 6. Fifteenthly, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tells us, that this <hi>Sion</hi> is a Publick Bleſſing to all ſorts of Perſons; the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> Pſal. 14. 7, &amp; 53. 6; which <hi>Sion</hi> is elſewhere called, the <hi>Joy of the whole Earth,</hi> Pſa. 48. 2; from whence the Bleſſing was Deſired, <hi>pſa.</hi> 20. 2; and Pronounced, <hi>pſa.</hi> 134. 3; and Promiſed, <hi>pſa.</hi> 128. 5; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>pſa.</hi> 133. 3. And thus, upon <hi>Mount Sion</hi> ſhall be Deliverance, and by that means the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall regain their Poſſeſſions, <hi>Obad.</hi> 17: <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be that <hi>Bow</hi> in God's hand, which ſendeth forth <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Arrows into their Enemies Hearts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 13. The Pureſt Saints, though they be leaſt Eſteemed, yet are they the <hi>Earth's Salt,</hi> which keeps it from
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102526:90"/> Putrefaction, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 13; in whoſe Sight the Nations ſhall walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24; and be Healed by the Leaves of their Tree, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22 2, which whileſt they Pluck off, like the Stag in the Fable, they do but thereby ſtrip themſelves of their own Safeguard. Laſtly, He tells us, that the Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> were to be carried Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> Pſa. 137. 1, who then would be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over, both by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> v. 3, and <hi>Edomites,</hi> v. 7: But yet withall, he addeth, that God will Save <hi>Sion,</hi> Pſa. 69. 35; and Return her Captivity, <hi>pſa.</hi> 126. 1, unto her own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Admiration, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3; and that he will Gloriouſly Appear in the Building of her up, <hi>pſa.</hi> 102. 16; who then will be Deſtructive to her Enemies, by Land, <hi>pſa.</hi> 76. 3, 4, 5, and by Sea, <hi>pſa.</hi> 48. 7, for all thoſe that <hi>hate her,</hi> ſhall <hi>be confounded,</hi> pſ. 129. 5; upon whoſe ruines <hi>ſhe</hi> ſhall be Raiſed, and therefore ſhe heareth and is Glad becauſe of Gods Judgements, <hi>pſa.</hi> 97. 8, as ſhe is then Bid to be, <hi>pſa.</hi> 48. 11. And thus this Myſtical <hi>Sion</hi> was to become a Wilderneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 9; from whence that Voice is heard, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w are we ſpoyled,</hi> Jer. 9. 19; being ſtript of all her Beauty, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 6; and Plowed up as a Field, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 12; ſo as that Others ſhould call her an <hi>Outcaſt,</hi> whom None ſought after, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 17; and ſhe ſhould account her ſelf <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> of her God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 14; and one whom his Soul loathed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 19: But yet her <hi>Dead men</hi> ſhall live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19; and when ſhe falleth, ſhe ſhall Riſe again, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 8; the Lord will make her that Halted a Remnant, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 7; and ſhe ſhall be re-built upon her own heap,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102526:91"/> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 17, 18; her <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> ſhall be made like <hi>Eden, Iſa.</hi> 51. 3; and thither ſhall the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed of the Lord</hi> come with <hi>Songs, Iſa.</hi> 35. 10; and her Latter State ſhall be more Glorious than the Former; her Redeemed ones ſhall <hi>ſee Eye to Eye,</hi> Iſa. 52. 8; and ſhe ſhall be called <hi>The Sion of the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 60. 14; and her Raiſing will be upon her Enemies Ruines, becauſe that Time will be the <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>Sion</hi>'s <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> Iſa. 34. 8.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſumme of what <hi>David</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth concerning <hi>Sion:</hi> With whom <hi>Paul</hi> fully agreeth, when he calleth this <hi>Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of all Goſpel-Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26; and when he deſcribeth this <hi>Myſtical Sion,</hi> or this Choiſer ſort of Things and Perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, as being the <hi>City of the Living God,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>general Aſſembly</hi> and <hi>Church of the Firſt-born which are written in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>the Spirits of Juſt men made Perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>A Man after God's own Heart, is partly to be known, by that Acquaintance which he hath with this <hi>Sion,</hi> in every of thoſe reſpects before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning the Principal and Neceſſary Qualifications of Civil Rulers; affirming that He who Ruleth over Men, muſt be Juſt, Ruling in the fear of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 3; adding withal, that ſuch kind of Rulers, ſhall flouriſh like the tender Graſs by clear ſhining after Rain; and ſhall be like a Bright riſing Sun, very acceptable and full of encreaſing Glory, <hi>v.</hi> 4; and though he foreſaw that his Immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours would not be ſuch, yet did he verily
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102526:91"/> Believe that ſuch ſhould be raiſed up, ſuitable to what Himſelf was, and by virtue of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, which would Eminently take place in the Latter dayes, notwithſtanding the preſent and future unworthineſs of his own Houſe, which was likely to Prevent it's Growth, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. But on the other ſide, he ſaith, that the Sons of Belial (or ſuch as did caſt off Chriſts Yoak) ſhall then be all of them as Thorns thruſt away and utterly burnt with fire, becauſe they cannot be Taken or Touched, without being ſenced with iron or the ſtaff of a Spear, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. All which is uttered by him, as being his laſt words, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. ſpoken by inſpiration from his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>v,</hi> 2. who is the God and Rock of <hi>Iſrael, v.</hi> 3. which maketh them to be the more Obſervable, ſince the laſt words of any man (and then much more, a Good man) are full of weight, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch Words as the Lord himſelf doth ſpeak by ſuch a man.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo Witneſſeth, that thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rulers and higher Powers which are Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, are not a Terrour to Good works, but to the Evil, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, executing Wrath upon him that doth Evil, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that doth Good, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>A man after Gods own heart, doth very well know that a Wicked man may Providentially be ſet over others, in a way of Judgment, <hi>pſ.</hi> 109. 6; but yet he will boldly witneſs, what ſuch ſhould be, and muſt be, if according to what the Lord hath Ordained and Appointed in his Law. He is farr from being offended with thoſe who do Deſire that none but Men fearing God might be in Place of Power. He looketh upon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102526:92"/> this to be the Chief Qualification required in ſuch; whilſt others are well enough ſatisfied with the Vileſt Perſons, ſave as their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt is thereby prejudiced.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning the Beſt Man's Vantiy; affirming that Every man at his Beſt ſtate is altogether Vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 5; and that men of Low degree are Vanity, and that men of High degree are a Lie, who if laid in the Ballance are altogether lighter than Vanity, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 62. 9; and that no King is ſaved by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an Hoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 16; and that Princes are not to be Truſted in, in whom there is no help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. 3; and therefore he Hated thoſe who regarded ſuch lying vanities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 6, and ſharply rebuked them who ſought after this kind of Leaſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 2, <hi>viz. Sauls</hi> Party, who truſting in their Prince, did thereupon vainly conclude, that they ſhould have been too hard for <hi>David.</hi> He teſtifieth alſo, concerning Man's vanity, in Spiritual as well as Natural reſpects; which he Exemplifieth at large in <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe of old, who ſoon forgat Gods wondrous works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13, which at the firſt they were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with, <hi>ver.</hi> 12; who made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, but did not keep it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 10; and notwithſtanding his Judgments upon others, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, and Mercies to themſelves, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, they ſinned yet more againſt him, <hi>v,</hi> 17; nay and though he corrected them alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, for all this they ſinned ſtill, <hi>ver.</hi> 32; and when they ſought him in their Affliction, <hi>ver.</hi> 34, yet did they but flatter him with their mouth, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. for their Heart was not Right with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 37;

            <p>A man after Gods own heart is of a Diſcerning Spirit, and Judgeth every man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15; and therefore he is not ſo apt to ſtumble upon falling Profeſſors, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18, 19; nor doth he Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the Opinion of a poor vain Creature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3; nor will he over-peremptorily undertake for any man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12; nor will he commit himſelf to every one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24; nor doth he ground upon fair Promiſes and ſmooth tongues, and forward good beginnings, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth partly how vain man is.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning the Proper

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that the Son of the Bond-woman ſhall not be Heir with the Son of the Free-woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30; and that ungodly men ſhall not inherit the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10; being Alienated from the Life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18; and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12, the Children of wrath, <hi>v.</hi> 3; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9; and which ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come upon them, as travail upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3.

            <p n="13">13.

            <p>Thence it is, that a Gracious heart endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to be Holy, becauſe God is ſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16; who will by no means clear the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 7, and much leſs thoſe whom he hath known of all the Families of the Earth, <hi>Am.</hi> 3. 2.</p>

            <p n="15">15. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning the Nature of God's <hi>good preſence:</hi> The Creature's Preſence may yield ſome kind of momentany comfort, but in the Preſence of <hi>God</hi> there is <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Joy, and <hi>pleaſures</hi> for Evermore, <hi>pſa.</hi> 16. 11: and

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth Children to Requite their Parents, for that is good and Acceptable before God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4: and Rich men to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well-pleaſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16: and Profeſſors to Pray for the Converſion of others, for this is good and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. 3; and to be <hi>transformed</hi> by the Renewing

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102526:106"/> his being Related as a Father; the Diſcovery of which ſpecial Relation, was reſerved of old, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Aſcending out of the land of <hi>Egypt, Ho.</hi> 11. 1, which is applied to Chriſt upon a like occaſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15. and who is ſaid (Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtatively) to be begotten that very Day, when he was Raiſed up, in order to his Aſcenſion and Exaltation, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33; where <hi>Paul</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr with <hi>David,</hi> in witneſſing concerning God the Father, as he alſo doth in ſeveral other places.</p>
            <p>Though alſo, the Father may be ſignified by this word Jehovah, as it doth (moſt Properly) import his Being of himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 6; in which reſpect, that Title is alſo given unto the Son, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6, and to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 25, with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 8, 9, in a General ſence, or as theſe Three are all one God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7: but yet in a ſpecial ſence, that name Jehovah doth more Peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong unto the Father, becauſe He alone (with reference unto the Son and Spirit) may be ſaid to have his Being of Himſelf, whereas the Son is ſaid to be Begotten by the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16, and the Spirit is ſaid to Proceed from both, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 26.</p>
            <p>Now men of an Antichriſtian ſpirit, doe hence appear, not to be men after Gods own Heart, as <hi>David</hi> was; becauſe they do (virtually at leaſt) Deny, that Chriſt is the Son, (by keeping up what he hath Abrogated, and by Impoſing what he hath not appointed) and ſo by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they alſo do Deny the Father, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 22. and 4. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> both as to his Deity and Properties.</p>

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth that the Spirit is very God, when he applyeth that to this <hi>Spirit, Act.</hi> 28. 25. which elſewhere is ſpoken of Jehovah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 8, 9: and when he affirmeth that this <hi>Spirit</hi> and God are both one, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17, 18: and when he calleth this Spirit Eternal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14: and when he affirmeth it to be the ſearcher of All things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10: and when he aſcribeth unto it a Power to Raiſe the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11: and when he maketh this <hi>Spirit</hi> the Joynt-object of prayer, together with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14: and when he ſaith that Goſpel-ſaints are the temples of this <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, as well as of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, is one who will not deny the proper God head of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> tells us, that this Spirit of God is Holy, <hi>pſ.</hi> 51. 11; which may be ſaid to be ſo, Partly becauſe it Worketh whatever Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is in the creature, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth oft witneſs: but eſpecially, becauſe it is Holy in it ſelf; and cannot endure unholineſs in another, being apt to be Grieved therewith, as <hi>Paul</hi> informeth us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30, if not Quenched, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> tells us, that this Holy Spirit is alſo Free, <hi>pſ.</hi> 51. 12; which may be ſaid to be ſo; Partly becauſe it is of the moſt Noble or Princely ſtock, (as the ſame Hebrew word is oft tranſlated) proceeding from the Father; Partly becauſe it acteth Liberaly, as Earthly Nobles or Princes uſe to doe: Partly becauſe it doth make them Free (in every good reſpect) in whom it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17: But eſpecially becauſe it is a moſt Free Agent, in every of its Motions and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102526:108"/> and in which reſpect <hi>Paul</hi> ſtileth it a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> both as he is God, and Man, and Mediatour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as he is God; and ſo <hi>David</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly cal him God, <hi>pſ</hi> 45. 6. which <hi>Paul</hi> interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth concerning Chriſt, as he is the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. So alſo, <hi>David</hi> doth declare him to be a God by Nature, when he ſaith that the Heavens and Earth are the work of his hands, <hi>pſal.</hi> 102. 25; which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to be meant of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. So alſo, when <hi>David</hi> ſtileth Chriſt, his Lord, <hi>pſ.</hi> 110. 1; from whence Chriſt argueth his own being more than a Man, <hi>Mat,</hi> 22. 44, 45, unto the utter ſilencing of thoſe Phariſaical <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, v.</hi> 46, however ſome ſince are bold to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſtill whether Chriſt be very God.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt is <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5: for whom, and by whom all things were Made, and do conſiſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16, 17, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3; which clearly proveth that he is very God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4: who hath neither End of Life, nor Beginning of Dayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3: and who will one day Appear the <hi>Great God,</hi> as well as his People's <hi>Saviour,</hi> Tit. 2. 13. A man after Gods own Heart, will witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (and not Deny) the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning Chriſt, as to his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> alſo; in which reſpect, he calleth God the God of Chriſt, <hi>pſa.</hi> 45. 7, as <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8; who had a Father, as he was God the Son; but as he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102526:108"/> was a Man, he had a God. Nay and <hi>David</hi> did alſo foretell, that Chriſt (as Man) ſhould be of the Fruit of his Body, <hi>pſa.</hi> 132. 11, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth explain it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 30; which <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo witneſs unto, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 22, 23; affirming that Chriſt was Made (which covertly aſſerts his Godhead) of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3; who elſe-where ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>took</hi> on him, not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2. 16; which as it doth clearly prove, that Chriſt was truely Man, ſo alſo that he was very God; ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he could not be ſaid to Take man's Nature on him, which Act doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe his Pre-exiſtent Being, and as he muſt needs be God, it being there denyed that he ever was a Proper Angel.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>David</hi> foretold, that Chriſt ſhould be very Man, ſo alſo, that in that Humane Nature he ſhould be ſuddenly Raiſed from the Dead, <hi>pſal.</hi> 16. 10, and that he ſhould ſit therein on God's Right hand in Heaven, <hi>pſal.</hi> 110. 1, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth explain it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 31, 34: the being of which Humane Nature now in Heaven, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teſtified by <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, that he who Deſcended into the Grave (which onely ſuiteth with Chriſt's Humane Body) is the ſame who Aſcended into Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 9, 10; from whence he alſo looked for his Appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, which word <hi>Appearing</hi> doth not agree with his Godhead ſtrictly taken, nor is it ever uſed, ſave with reference unto his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own Heart, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102526:109"/> (which yet too many at this day doe) that Chriſt ſtill is, both very God, and alſo very Man.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is <hi>God-man,</hi> or Mediatour; and that both in a <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Relatively,</hi> or as he ſtood Related unto this Mediatour; and ſo he calleth Chriſt, His <hi>Lord,</hi> Pſa. 110. 1: as <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo very often; both in relation to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2; affirming him to be the Chriſtians Onely Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6; and that no man can true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay this, but by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, is for a <hi>ſpecial Application</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf; and cannot content himſelf with knowing what Chriſt is, without ſome more Peculiar Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and him. And as he is deſirous to know Chriſt under the conſideration of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo alſo, he doth freely own him as a Lord, and as His Lord in particular. Chriſt is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's Husband, and yet ſuch call him Lord, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did her Husband, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do all his Spouſes worſhip him, becauſe he is their Lord, <hi>pſa.</hi> 45. 11. And thus doth <hi>David</hi> call him, in the Spirit, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 43, or in Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24; and not onely in a way of flattering Complement, as the moſt doe now, and as the worſt will one day doe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator, as he is <hi>Abſolutely</hi> conſidered; both in relation to his <hi>Spiritual Beauty,</hi> his peculiar Priviledges, his ſpecial Graces, his Uſage in the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102526:109"/> World, and every of his Offices, as he is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth unto Chriſt's <hi>ſpiritual Beauty</hi> or Deſireableneſs, when he tearmeth him <hi>fairer than the Children of men,</hi> Pſal. 45. 2. Which Deſireableneſs of his, <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us a more particular account of, when he telleth us, that all the treaſures of Wiſdome and Knowledge are hid in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3: <hi>who is the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. 3: in whom all <hi>fulneſs</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19, the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,</hi> Col. 2. 9, and therefore his people are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> in him, <hi>v.</hi> 10; to be with whom for ever, is that wherein their future Happineſs conſiſteth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own Heart, doth count Chriſt <hi>white and ruddy,</hi> the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> Cant. 5. 10, yea <hi>altogether Lovely,</hi> v. 16; whom therefore he loveth with his <hi>Soul,</hi> Cant. 1. 7, as all the <hi>upright</hi> doe, <hi>v.</hi> 4, yea even the very Virgins, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning Chriſt's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Priviledges,</hi> when he calleth God <hi>His God, pſa.</hi> 45. 7, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9: who might not ſee Corruption, <hi>pſa.</hi> 16. 10, with <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 35: who did become the Head-ſtone in the Corner, <hi>pſa.</hi> 118. 22, with <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 11: whom the Father bad, Sit at his Right hand, untill he made his Enemies his Footſtool, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 1; reſolving to Advance him, in deſpight of all Oppoſers, <hi>pſal.</hi> 2. 6; and promiſing to ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 5, on Chriſt's right hand.</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:102526:110"/>
            <p> So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that Chriſt is appointed Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2: whom God hath ſet at his Right hand <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 20: having given him a Name above every name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9: and having made him the Head of all Principality and power; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10: who is the firſt born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, and the firſt born from the dead, that in all things he might have the Preheminence, <hi>v.</hi> 18. All which a gracious heart is comfortably acquainted with, as being therein repreſented by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6; or at leaſt, compleat in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10, and ſome way Benefited, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, with reference to all thoſe Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning his ſpecial <hi>Graces.</hi> And ſo he telleth us, that Chriſt was uſeful unto All, receiving Gifts for Men, yea for the Rebellious alſo, <hi>pſa.</hi> 68. 18, but more eſpecially for the Saints, as <hi>Paul</hi> intepreteth that Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. 12, in whom is all his Delight, and unto whom his Goodneſſe did extend, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. 3, though not to God, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, which was an argument of his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and wherein <hi>David</hi> was his Type, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>v.</hi> 10. He was hated without a cauſe, <hi>pſ.</hi> 35. 19, with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 25. The reproaches of them that reproached God, fell upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9; which <hi>Paul</hi> interpreteth to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſelf-denial, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>He loved righteouſneſs and hated wickedneſs, pſ.</hi> 45. 7. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. He reſolved to make God his Truſt, <hi>pſ.</hi> 18. 2, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13. The zeal of God's Houſe did eat him up, <hi>pſ.</hi> 69. 9, with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 17. He delighted to do Gods will with reference unto his ſufferings, having his Ears opened, <hi>pſ.</hi> 40. 6. 8,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102526:110"/> which <hi>Paul</hi> rendreth a Preparing of his Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. perhaps to hint unto us, that when a Chriſtians Ear is Opened, unto a Call from God to Suffer, his Body will be then Prepared for it, however it might ſeem unfit before for ſuch an undertaking.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that Chriſt taſted Death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9; and that being Rich, he became Poor for his People's ſakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9: not Pleaſing himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 3: loving Righteouſneſs and Hating Iniquity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9: being faithful to him who did Appoint him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2: learning Obedience by what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, although he were a Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8, and though he was equal with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, yet was he in faſhion as a Man, <hi>v.</hi> 8, and taking upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>v.</hi> 7, became Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto Death, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>All which Graces of his, a man of <hi>David</hi>'s ſpirit is well acquainted with, and is thereby ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto an holy Imitation of him, in every of thoſe and ſuch like reſpects.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning Chriſt's uſage in the world, from God and Man. He was in Appearance Forſaken of his God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d under which cloud his Sun went down, <hi>pſ.</hi> 22. 1, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. He was betrayed by his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend, <hi>pſ.</hi> 41. 9, with <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 18. He was Oppoſed by the Great ones of the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1, with <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25. He was Rejected by the Profeſſors of that time, <hi>pſ.</hi> 118. 22, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 42. And whilſt he was upon the Croſs, ſome parted his Garments, <hi>pſ.</hi> 22. 18. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 35; others Derided at his former Faith, <hi>pſ.</hi> 22. 8,

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that he was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily put to death, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 28; and that he was in all points Tempted like as we are, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>All which a Gracious heart doth labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, unto the fitting of him for ſuch like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 20; and the compoſing of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24; who thereby alſo is encouraged to Beg for mercy in ſuch a like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16, and humbly to expect it, ſince Chriſt himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth concerning every of Chriſt's Offices, as he is a Prophet, Prieſt, and King.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he was a Prophet, or as he did ſpeak in Parables, and uttered Dark ſayings, <hi>pſal.</hi> 78. 2, and 49. 4, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 35. Which Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical (or Preaching) Office of his, is alſo witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto by <hi>Paul,</hi> both in relation to the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8, and Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, from <hi>pſ.</hi> 18. 49.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart doth therefore count Chriſt his onely Maſter in compariſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 10; nor is he offended with the darkneſs of his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but ſeeketh unto him in ſuch a caſe for help, as his Diſciples were wont to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth, that Chriſt is a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck, pſ.</hi> 110. 4, with <hi>Ioh</hi> 12. 34.</p>
            <p>Which Prieſthood of his, <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto at large, both after <hi>Aaron's</hi> order, and <hi>Melchizedecks;</hi> affirming him to be a Merciful

            <p> The Wages of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> were, the Tithes of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spoyls; which <hi>Abraham</hi> did freely give him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20, reſerving nothing for himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 23, ſave what his men had eaten, <hi>v.</hi> 24: To ſignifie unto us, that Tithes did Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ſhadow out Chriſt's Due; which Tithes were payd to <hi>Levi</hi> afterwards, but that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was onely for a Time, together with the Change whereof, this Law for Tithes was alſo changed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. 12: So that the Advocates for Tithes (at this Day) muſt prove, both that a Maintenance may now be <hi>forced,</hi> and that this kind of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſpecial <hi>properties</hi> annexed to <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi>'s Prieſthood (above that of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s) were chiefly Three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was King as well as Prieſt, and <hi>King of Salem,</hi> which is <hi>King of Peace, Heb.</hi> 7. 2; whereas <hi>Aaron</hi> was Onely Prieſt, whileſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was his Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 11, or King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 5: To ſignifie unto us, that Chriſt is both King and Prieſt, or a Prieſt

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was alſo <hi>King of Righteouſneſs</hi> (or Eminently Righteous) as he was Prieſt, which <hi>Paul</hi> inferreth from the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 2, concerning whom there is no failing mentioned; whereas <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Poſterity had their Infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28, in which reſpect they needed daily to offer up Sacrifices for their own ſins firſt, <hi>v.</hi> 27: To ſignifie unto us, that Chriſt is ſuch an High-prieſt, who is holy, harmleſs and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and (principally) <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was a Prieſt for Ever, as <hi>David</hi> doth expreſſely tell us, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 4, whoſe Everlaſtingneſs in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>Paul</hi> cleareth up, from the Scripture's ſilence concerning his Birth and Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3, and therefore it is Preſumptuous as well as vain, for any to Conjecture, who this <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was; whereas <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Poſterity were Many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23: To ſignifie unto us, that Chriſt becauſe he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Ever hath an Unchangeable Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24, which <hi>Paul</hi> doth there further argue, from his being made Prieſt with an Oath, <hi>v.</hi> 20, which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Poſterity were not, <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of all which, a man after God's own heart doth comfortably underſtand; who doubteth not but that Chriſt will faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his whole Work before-mentioned: who therefore is freely willing to give him all his forenamed Tithes or Dues: and who alſo doth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102526:113"/> Hopefully wait upon him for Mercy and Grace to help in time of need, ſince he is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> becauſe he is a Righteous King and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull High-Prieſt; eſpecially ſince he Ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them that come unto God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> doth alſo teſtifie, concerning <hi>Chriſts Kingly Office,</hi> whom the Father is reſolved to ſet as King in his holy Hill of <hi>Sion, pſa.</hi> 2. 6, and that he ſhall Rule in the midſt of his Enemies, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 2; having given him the Heathen for his Poſſeſſion, whom he ſhall break with a Rod of Iron, <hi>pſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9; in which reſpect the Greateſt of them are bid to be Wiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 10, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Servants, <hi>v.</hi> 11; for all his Enemies muſt be made his Foot-ſtool, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 1, who ſhall wound the Heads over many Countreys, filling the places with their Dead bodies, <hi>v.</hi> 6; the Scepter of whoſe Kingdom is a right Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and whoſe Throne ſhall be for Ever, <hi>pſa.</hi> 45. 6. The Rod of whoſe ſtrength ſhall come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> or whoſe Kingdom will be ſet up among a Choiſer Remnant, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 2, who ſhall be made <hi>willing</hi> to receive him, in the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Holineſs, <hi>(viz.</hi> Solemnly and Publickly, as Temple-worſhip was wont of Old to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) and they ſhall then be gathered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingly Intereſt, as the Dew is by the Sun, from the womb of the Morning, in its Youth, or at its firſt Riſing, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 3; <hi>viz.</hi> Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, Speedily, and without Tarrying for Man's Order, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 7. But this work will meet with Difficulties, ſuch as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Wilderneſs, who yet met with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102526:113"/> ſome refreſhing Brook continually, before they fainted, and ſo went on; in alluſion whereunto, it is ſaid that Chriſt at this time ſhall drink of the Brook by the way, therefore ſhall he lift up the head, <hi>pſ.</hi> 110. 7.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes preached, that there was Another King, one <hi>Jeſus, Act.</hi> 17. 2. 7; whoſe Kingdom then was meerly <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but yet he telleth us elſewhere, that it ſhall be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> in the World (or State of things) to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5, which we yet ſee not, <hi>v.</hi> 8, nor ſhall doe (as to its Fulneſs) till his Appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1; who then ſhall Reign, till he ſhall have put all his Enemies (and Death among the reſt) under his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25, 26: in which reſpect, he telleth us, that Chriſt ſprang out of <hi>Juda,</hi> the Kingly Tribe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 14, and that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech</hi> was his fulleſt Type, who was both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> v. 1; whoſe Name doth ſignifie, the <hi>King of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and who was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>peace;</hi> to hint unto us, that Chriſt's Kingly Diſpenſation will be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly repleniſhed with Peace and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And thus I have now finiſhed the firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branch of that Outward Demonſtration which <hi>David</hi> gave of his being a man after God's own Heart; <hi>viz.</hi> from his profeſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or noble Teſtimony, concerning all theſe forenamed Things and Perſons.</p>
            <p>From whence I ſhall now proceed unto the Second Branch of that Demonſtration; to ſhew how <hi>David</hi> did evidence himſelf to be ſuch a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102526:114"/> one, by his Perſonal and conſtant Practice or Carriage, both in relation unto the Creature and unto God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>David</hi> did Practically evidence his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man after God's own heart, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his carriage towards the <hi>Creature.</hi> As for Example:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> was Prudent in matters, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 18; Behaving himſelf <hi>wiſely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 5, in all his wayes, <hi>v.</hi> 14, more wiſely than all the Servants of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo that his Name was much ſet by, <hi>v.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth concerning <hi>Paul</hi>'s Wiſdom, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15, which he did abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence both in his <hi>practice, writing</hi> and <hi>preaching;</hi> who being holily Crafty, would not Burden the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16, that ſo he might cut off occaſion from thoſe who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12: who <hi>wiſely</hi> confuted the <hi>Athenians</hi> Idolatry, from their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of an <hi>unknown God, Act.</hi> 17. 22, 23: and who knew how to comply for a while with ſome men's Weakneſs, ſo as yet not to Indulge their Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21, 22: ſtealing upon thoſe proud <hi>Corinthians</hi> by Degrees, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at firſt to be their Liberty and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7, 9, which afterwards he meant more ſharply to reuke them for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1, 22.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own Heart is a <hi>diſcreet</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> man; who doth not Behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Light Vain Childiſh way, (as too many Profeſſors doe) but <hi>wiſely;</hi> and who in that re-regard doth out-ſtrip the higheſt Formaliſt, or
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102526:114"/> ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi>'s ordinary Servants were.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> was very Humble in his carriage, who ſcorned not to return unto his keeping ſheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 19, after his being annointed King, <hi>v.</hi> 13; yea after that <hi>Saul</hi> had entertained him in his Court, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 15. And when he was communed with, about being <hi>Sauls</hi> Son in Law, he thought it too great an Honour for him, who was a Poor man and Lightly eſteemed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 22, 23, ſo little was he elevated with his late merited applauſe, <hi>v.</hi> 7. And when he was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecured by <hi>Saul</hi> afterwards, he thought himſelf unworthy of ſo great a Dignity, as being a dead Dog or Flea, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. Nay and when he was a King, he took not any Proud ſtate upon him, but when he was to ſpeak unto his Subjects, he ſtood upon his feet, and call'd them Brethren, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 2.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, is partly to be known by his Humility, which is indeed the Gloſs of all his other Graces. He is a King to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10; and yet that Oyl upon his head, doth not ſo lift up his heart, but that he can buckle to the loweſt duty incumbent upon him, between his Coronation and Anointing. He can bear being fetched from the ſheepfold to the Court, and being carryed back from thence unto his ſheep again. His deſerved Commendations doe not make him Haughty; nor doth it ſeem a Light thing to him, to be ſo much as Outwardly advanced, notwithſtanding his moſt glorious Exploits. He counteth the creature Magnified by Afflicting viſitations, as if it were an Honour to be a ſufferer, <hi>Job,</hi> 7. 17, 18. His outward dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102526:115"/> doth not encreaſe his inward Height, ſo as to make him forget that his Inferiours are ſtill his Brethren.</p>
            <p>In which reſpect <hi>Paul</hi> was a famous Inſtance; who was not willing to rob Chriſt of His Glory, by being too highly eſteemed himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13: who was content that others ſhould ſhare with him in the honour of Enditing his Epiſtle, ſuch as <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12: <hi>Timotheus,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1; <hi>Silvanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 1; and ſometimes all the brethren with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1, 2: who would not that any ſhould think of him above what he was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6, or above what is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6: who ſtiled himſelf the leaſt of the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9; and leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8; and their Servant for Jeſus ſake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5, although he was not a whit behind the very Chiefeſt of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5, but did excel them in point of Gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 18, and Priviledges, and Duty, both Active and Paſſive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22, 23: who alſo would not have others to be wiſe in their own conceit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16; or to think that they know any thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2, above what they ought to think, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3; but to be condeſcending to men of Low eſtate, <hi>v.</hi> 16, and in Honour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on another, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> was obedient unto his Father, when he was bid by him, to take his Load upon his back, and to Run on Foot therewith unto his Brethren, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 17, 18, 20. And though <hi>Saul</hi> was alſo Dutiful unto his father, in his going to ſeek the Aſſes, as hath been before obſerved; yet <hi>David</hi> did farr outſtrip him; ſince <hi>Saul</hi> was

            <p>The greateſt outward advancement will not make a Gracious Child to Diſobey his Parents, in what is meet and lawful; much leſs to Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them, as many at this day doe, (when they they are a little Raiſed) who yet would be thought to be of <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit. In relation to which particular Duty, <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth an example alſo, who ſent his Apoſtolical Salutation to his Mother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 13; and biddeth others, that they ſhould in All things Obey their Parents, for this is well pleaſing to the Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20; and that they ſhould Obey them in the Lord, for this is Right, and is the firſt commandement with Promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1, 2: who alſo telleth us, that Diſobedience unto Parents, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30, is one ſad Character of a Reprobate, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> was careful of his Truſt, who left not his ſheep without a Keeper, when himſelf was otherwiſe employed by his father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 20, although his envious Brother did cauſeleſſely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him in that regard, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart doth ſo attend unto one Duty as not to neglect another. He will fulfil his fathers whole will; and hath a more Eſpecial eye unto what is his conſtant work, that it be no way prejudiced by that which is Occaſionally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him. He ſeeketh to Prevent a Damage in his Abſence, and is willing to be Every where employed at once, ſo far as in him lyeth. A not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance whereof we have in <hi>Paul,</hi> who dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attended unto that work which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20; reſolving not to ſtir, until he had performed it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 28,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102526:116"/> whatever hardſhips he met with, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4: nor was he onely thus careful whilſt Preſent, but when he was Abſent alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27, having the care of All the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28, and ſtrictly charging thoſe with whom that Flock was left, which he was never likely to ſee any more, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 25, 28, 29.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> was of a very Meek and Quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in a caſe of Perſonal provocation; who was as a man that Heareth not, and in whoſe mouth are no Reproofs, whilſt others ſpake miſchievous things againſt him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 38. 12, 13, 14. When his eldeſt Brother's Anger was kindled againſt him, in a way of Envy and falſe ſurmiſes, he onely anſwered, <hi>What have I now done? is there not a cauſe?</hi> and ſo turned away from him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any further wrangling, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 28, 29, 30. Nor was he of a ſelf-revenging diſpoſition, witneſs his ſparing <hi>Saul,</hi> when his Life was put into his hand, a firſt and ſecond time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13, and 26. 11: nor did he Rejoyce at the news of <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, but Lamented over him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 17, and did not Derogate from his deſerved praiſes, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 21, although he had been his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Adverſary. He alſo faſted and Prayed for his Enemies, <hi>pſal.</hi> 35. 13, 14; and did Avenge the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 16, and <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 11, of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>So alſo, though <hi>Paul</hi> had a readineſs to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all Diſobedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, yet did he not delight to uſe the Rod, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21, or to exerciſe Dominion over others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24; but did Beſeech (whilſt Abſent) by the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt, that ſo he might

            <p>Let thoſe who are of an Envious Revengefull and Paſſionate Spirit know, that a man after Gods own heart is of another Temper. He can deal Plainly with Offendors, and yet give them their Deſerved praiſes. He can wiſely vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Wrong, and yet without Revenge. He can be Angry, but it is not without Juſt Cauſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22; nor is it Raſh or Haſty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 17; nor is it Feirce or Cruel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 7; nor doth it bereave of Reaſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 11; nor doth it Indiſpoſe for Duty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19, 31; nor doth it uſually Tranſport in a ſinful way, <hi>pſal.</hi> 106. 33, but is kept within its due bounds, and Occaſions of that nature are Turned from, as in the caſe of <hi>David</hi> before mentioned; who did not Politickly command his <hi>Paſſion</hi> at ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time onely, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27; but that which was in <hi>Saul</hi> a Tranſient vertue, was in the other a more Habitual Gracious Frame, who did not Indulge or Glory in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102526:117"/> ſometimes Haſty, but did Confeſs it with holy ſhame, <hi>pſa.</hi> 116. 11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>David</hi> was eminently Courageous, in the way of his Duty; which added unto the Luſtre of his forenamed Meekneſs. He was a mighty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man, and a man of War, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 18, who durſt take a Lion by the beard (although he had a Bear to back him) in a way of Reſcuing his poor Lamb, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 34, 35. He modeſtly waved that Offer of being <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſon in Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he was put to purchaſe it with his ſword, and then it did pleaſe him well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 23. 26. When <hi>Saul</hi> and all his Army were Diſmayed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 11, and fled from that vapouring <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, v.</hi> 24, becauſe of his great Height, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, and mighty Armour, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, and big words, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10; <hi>David</hi> then bad that no mans heart ſhould fail, for he would go and fight with him, <hi>v.</hi> 32, although he was but then a Youth, <hi>v.</hi> 33, and ran to meet him, <hi>ver.</hi> 48, (when <hi>Saul</hi> had given him order, <hi>v.</hi> 37.) and ſlew him, without any ſword, <hi>v.</hi> 50, or outward Armour, <hi>v.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart will encounter both with a Bear and Lion, rather than the leaſt of Chriſt's Lambs ſhall be devoured. He will not plead, that ſuch a Truth or Duty is a ſorry little thing, not worthy the hazard of his Life; but will Adventure to preſerve a poor ſhiftleſs Lamb, as much or more than other things. He is not ſo well pleaſed with outward Dignity, as with an opportunity of being uſeful, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome noble Duty, although accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with utmoſt Difficulty. He dareth to Encounter with not onely ſome of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>

Such Myſtical or Spiritual Exploits, are Ordinarily to be obſerved, among thoſe that are truely Gracious: and ſome ſuch Practice in the Letter, is that which a man of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit may be Diſtinguiſhed from others by, on this ſide that Time which <hi>David</hi>'s Diſpenſation ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified, or in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Life-time.</p>
            <p>In relation to which holy Courage, <hi>Paul</hi> was a ſecond <hi>David;</hi> who heartned others in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be Terrified, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28; and who was Eminent himſelf in that reſpect.

            <p n="8">8. <hi>David</hi> was Thankfull to his Friends, and more eſpecially to thoſe who were God's Friends as well as his.

            <p> A man after God's own Heart, is of a <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diſpoſition,</hi> and doth not forget any of his loving Friends; but yet he doth more <hi>eſpecially</hi> Reſpect thoſe of a Choiſer ſpirit, whom he will carefully Reſtore unto their Right of High-Prieſthood (or Higheſt Reputation) above all ſelf-ſeeking and falſe hearted Profeſſors, although theſe may Out-ſtrip the other, in point of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Courteſies.

            <p n="9">9. <hi>David</hi> was very <hi>paſſive</hi> in whatever tended unto his being outwardly Advanced.

            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> did not <hi>take</hi> upon himſelf that Honour of being an Apoſtle, untill he was Called
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102526:120"/> to it by the will of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2.

            <p n="10">10. <hi>David</hi> ſpared None of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Enemies (as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Agag)</hi> but Manfully reſiſted them All, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites, Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, Amalekites</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 12. 14, untill the Lord had given him Reſt round about from All his Enemies, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 1.

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpared no Spiritual Enemy (as others did) but Warred with Every high thing that exalted it ſelf againſt God and Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. That ſo he might be <hi>pure</hi> from the Blood of all men, he ſhunned not to declare the <hi>whole counſel of God</hi> unto them, though to his Own utmoſt hazard, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. 25, 26, 27. He might as well have Excuſed himſelf (as ſome others then did) from ſuch Adventures, and as <hi>David</hi> might, in relation to what he did for the men of <hi>Keilah;</hi> but though he was <hi>free</hi> from all men, yet did he make himſelf a Servant unto all, that he might Gain the more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19. And though he gained no more Love from ſome than <hi>David</hi> did from the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> yet was he Gladly <hi>ſpent</hi> for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. Nay when he did ſometimes Judaize, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3, (which ſeemeth to have been his failing, and for which he was in a like caſe afterwards Rebuked, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 26, 27, 28. 30, 31.) yet was he then at work for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s good, Deſigning thereby to Gain the <hi>Jews,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20: and if he had not been ſuſpitiouſly Prevented by thoſe carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> was by the <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Lords) he would hereby ſoon have undermined their whole <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi>

            <p>A man after God's own Heart is of a <hi>publick</hi> Spirit, impartially oppoſing whatever warreth againſt the Souls of others, and not daring to Indulge any of their ſpiritual Adverſaries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though himſelf may be but ill requited for his pains, and may have been more Courteouſly dealt with, by the chief Abettors of what he hath Adventurouſly reſiſted, for the Good and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his unthankful Friends. Nay when a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul doth ſeemingly comply with what in his Heart he Hateth, (as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did) yet doth he deſign thereby (when a fit occaſion ſerveth) to <hi>further</hi> that Truth which he is thought to <hi>prejudice.</hi> And though this kind of Practice cannot be denyed to have been the Failing of God's People in former times, (as may appear more fully afterwards) yet in a caſe like unto that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s, it hath alſo evidenced their <hi>publick Spirit,</hi> and that ſecret Love which they ſtill have had unto the Truths of Chriſt.</p>

            <p> A man after God's own heart, muſt needs be both Juſt and True, as to the conſtant tenor of his converſation.

            <p n="12">12. <hi>David</hi> was a lover of Plain dealing, both in an Active and Paſſive ſence.

And though <hi>Peter James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſeeming Pillars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9, yet when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw that they walked not uprightly according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>v.</hi> 14, he did withſtand <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, <hi>v.</hi> 11, and ſharply rebuked him before them all, <hi>v.</hi> 14, becauſe he was to be Blamed, <hi>v.</hi> 11, for his Diſſimulation, <hi>v.</hi> 13. And as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Grace appeared in his Active plain dealing; ſo <hi>Peter</hi>'s Grace was evidenced in his Patient bearing it, who then made no Reply, and who afterwards doth highly commend <hi>Paul</hi> for his Depth and Wiſdom, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15, 16, though he had Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102526:123"/> him to all Poſterity for his Hypocriſie, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Moſt men are of a flattering diſpoſition, and love to be Soothed up themſelves; but let ſuch know, that a Gracious heart is Wiſely Faithful, and will not ſcornfully Rebound a due Reproof, which is one ſad ſign of a very Hard and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 24. And as <hi>David's</hi> diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall get up, ſo thoſe ſhall ſpeak Plainly, who have been wont to ſtammer at a Reproof, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 4; and the leaſt Child ſhall be able to lead them, who have been wont to be like Lions when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>David</hi> had his affections under a very great Command. He ſo Lamented the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and (his dearly beloved) <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 17, as that at the very ſame time, he could inſtruct his Party to uſe the Bow, <hi>v.</hi> 18, whereby the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had been Conquerers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 3. A Gracious heart will ſo Mourn over a former loſs, as that he may be able to Prevent for the Future, by Learning to fight his Adverſary at the utmoſt Diſtance, as Archers uſe to doe, and as his Enemy hath done to him. And when his ſick child was Dead, he ceaſed then to faſt and Pray, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 20, as when he was alive, <hi>v.</hi> 16, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it Now was bootleſs, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. He that is Timely affected with a croſs Providence, is not ſo apt to Weep Unprofitably, as others doe. And when he did effeminately long for thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which could not be had without utmoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 14, 15; he would not Satisfie his Inordinate deſire with ſuch a Coſtly cup, but
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102526:124"/> poured it out unto the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. A Gracious heart will tremble to Indulge a Luſtfull appetite. And in relation to that Sin of Covetouſneſs he deſired that God would Divert his heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, by inclining it unto his Law, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 36. A gracious ſoul would not be of an Earthly mind.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> was for the Bridling of Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections; which Members upon Earth he would have Mortified, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. He would not that Saints ſhould ſorrow for their Dead Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as others which have no Hope, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13; nor would he have a Penitent Offendor to be ſwallowed up with overmuch Sorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. He would not that Chriſtians ſhould over zealouſly affect ſome lower Gifts though ſpiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12; much leſs would he have them to Indulge Effeminacy, in their Hair, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14, or worldly Faſhions, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. He would not be brought under the Power of any thing, though Lawful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12; much leſs would he cheriſh a ſinful Luſt, or make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14, who therefore did keep his Body under, and bring it into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27, being very Jealous leſt Chriſtian Liberty ſhould be abuſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. And as to that ſin of Covetouſneſs, he calleth it Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, reckoning it among thoſe things which ſhould not once be named among Profeſſors, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3, and for which ſin alone, a Brother is not to be kept company with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11: who alſo doth Profeſs, that he never had Coveted any mans Money or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel,

            <p>A man after Gods own heart, is taught ſo to Love the Creature; as that he may neither let go his Dominion over it, nor ceaſe to be Chriſts ſervant in the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>David</hi> was a careful Father, as his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> did more eſpecially experience; for whom he prayed, <hi>pſ.</hi> 72. 1, and whom he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently Inſtructed, as <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 4, (which he there ſeemeth to ſet down at large unto the end of the 9th.

And <hi>David</hi> doth there abundantly adviſe his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> to take heed of ſtrange Women or Wives, both in the Letter and Myſtery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 3. and 7. 24, whoſe bitter End and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words he biddeth him to Beware of; probably foreſeeing that this would be his chief Temptation, both as he was a Prophet, and as he was acquainted with his Natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ſadly aggravated <hi>Solomon</hi>'s after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, eſpecially ſince his Mother alſo gave him the ſame advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 1, 3.

            <p>Men of a Worldly ſpirit, are ſpiritually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall unto their Children, onely Providing for outward Greatneſs and Moral Education at the beſt: but a man after Gods own heart, doth chiefly preſs upon his Child to get an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; and laboureth to obviate thoſe Temptations which he is moſt ſubject unto; and doth moſt ſtrictly charge him, to walk Cloſely with the Lord, in a way of univerſal and ſincere obedience, all his dayes.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth Parents to bring up their Children in the <hi>Nurture and Admonition of the</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:102526:125"/> 
               <hi>Lord, Eph.</hi> 6. 4. And though Himſelf had no Natural children that we read of; yet as he was a ſpiritual Father, he did carefully Inſtruct ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and Correct thoſe whom he had begotten unto Chriſt, as all his Epiſtles evidence.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>David</hi> was alſo a very carefull Maſter in his Family, as appeared, both by his Choice of Servants, and by his looking to them. He De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his Houſe to God, as the Title of his thirtieth Pſalm doth ſhew, and according to what then was a Ceremonial Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 5; (the Myſtical import whereof is ſtill in force) into which Houſe of his, the Blind and Lame (who had been Deſpitefully ſet to keep him out of <hi>Sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> might not enter, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6. 8; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that he would not Harbour men ſpiritually Blind and Lame, (ſuch as thoſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 14.) who hindred him (as he was the Type of Chriſt) from being poſſeſſed of that <hi>Sion</hi> where the Lord had ſet him to be King, <hi>pſal.</hi> 2. 6. Which holy care of his in this reſpect, is elſewhere more clearly teſtified, by his reſolving, that a Liar and Deceitful worker ſhould neither <hi>dwell</hi> with him, nor <hi>tarry</hi> in his ſight, <hi>pſ.</hi> 101. 7, but that his Eyes ſhould be upon the <hi>faithfull</hi> of the Land, that they might <hi>dwell</hi> with him, and he that walked in a <hi>perfect way</hi> ſhould ſerve him, <hi>v.</hi> 6; and that himſelf would walk within his Houſe with a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> v. 2. And as he did Bleſs (or Pray for) the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 18, ſo did he in like manner Bleſs his Houſhold, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Nor was he wanting to do them Right, witneſs his ſore Avenging of that Abuſe which ſome of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102526:126"/> his Servants met with from thoſe unworthy <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6, wherein he was a ſpecial Type of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth Maſters to do the ſame things unto their Servants, as knowing that <hi>their</hi> Maſter alſo is in Heaven, with whom there is no reſpect of Perſons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 9. And as to the Choice of Servants, when <hi>John Mark</hi> (who was his Servant or Miniſter, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 5,) had ſinfully Deſerted that work whereto he was Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Paul</hi> would not entertain him ever after, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 37, 38; wherein he reſembled <hi>David,</hi> who was not willing that a Deceitful worker ſhould Dwell with him, or tarry in his ſight.</p>
            <p>A Gracious heart will do what in him lieth, to be furniſhed with Godly Servants, whom he will Command to keep the Way of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19, that ſo his Family may be a little Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5, whom he may comfortably hold Communion with, in the performance of Family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties; for whom he daily prayeth; and will not Deſpiſe their Cauſe, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 13.</p>
            <p n="16">16. When <hi>David</hi> was moved to bring the <hi>Ark</hi> of God's Preſence (which was the chief part of Worſhip then) from <hi>Kiriath-jearim</hi> into <hi>Sion,</hi> which he had lately gained from the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites,</hi> and made his Royal-Seat, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6, 7; he firſt Conſulted with his Leaders and all the Congregation, to know if they had any thing to Object againſt the Warrantableneſs of this Attempt, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 1, 2, and to obtain their <hi>free</hi> Concurrence with himſelf therein, which proved accordingly, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. He was a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102526:126"/> Prophet, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 30, yet did he not Diſdain to Adviſe with thoſe, who could pretend to no ſuch extraordinary Inſpiration. He was a King, yet would he not Impoſe upon his Subjects (in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion) without their own conſent. He was herein a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7, yet did he not improve his Uncontroulable Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his People were made Willing, no more than Chriſt doth, <hi>pſa.</hi> 110. 3.</p>
            <p>So alſo, when <hi>Paul</hi> was about to fetch (into Myſtical Sion) that Ark (or Goſpel truths) which had been formerly Hid in Legal Shadows, as the Literal Ark was in <hi>Kiriath-jearim,</hi> or the Field of Woods, <hi>pſa.</hi> 132. 6; yet he did Reaſon and Confer about theſe things, both with the common People, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 2, and with the chiefeſt Leaders, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. He had the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 40, yet did he not Enforce any, in a Commanding way, but onely gave his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>v.</hi> 25. He was an Apoſtle, yet did he not exerciſe Dominion over the Faith of others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24, but would have every one to be fully perſwaded in his own mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. He was in Chriſt's ſtead, yet did he ſpeak to others in a Beſeeching way, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>Men of an <hi>Antichriſtian-ſpirit</hi> are for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory Impoſition, in the things of God; but a Man after God's own heart, is for a Voluntary Reception, and is willing to hear whatever can be juſtly alleadged unto the contrary. Himſelf is fully ſatisfied, and yet he would not that others ſhould ſee with his Eyes, but with their own. He doth not firſt court the Affections, (much leſs conſtrain the Will) untill the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102526:127"/> be well informed, whoſe Dictates he would have the Will to follow. And as this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant temper of a Gracious Soul, ſo will it more eſpecially appear, when <hi>David</hi> ſhall come to Rule over all God's <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>David</hi> was the Friend and Companion of <hi>Good Men,</hi> but Hated others, in an Holy way. He was a Companion of all them that <hi>feared</hi> God, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 63; and all his Delight was in the moſt Excelling Saints <hi>pſa.</hi> 16. 3, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom his Goodneſs did extend, <hi>v.</hi> 2, and whoſe Horn ſhould be by him exalted, <hi>pſ.</hi> 75. 10. But he had not ſat with <hi>vain perſons,</hi> nor would he go in with Diſſemblers, but Hated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Evil-doers, <hi>pſa.</hi> 26. 4, 5, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Hatred, <hi>pſa.</hi> 139. 22; bidding them to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> from him, <hi>pſal.</hi> 6. 8, and reſolving Early to Deſtroy them, <hi>pſ.</hi> 101. 8, or at leaſtwiſe to Cut off all their Horns, <hi>pſal.</hi> 75. 10. He was a very <hi>humble</hi> man, but yet he would not <hi>know</hi> a Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon, <hi>pſa.</hi> 101. 4. He was a Loving man, and yet if any hated God, he hated them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might be his Perſonal Friends.

            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> was much Comforted with ſuch as <hi>Titus,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6; but he was an utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unto Intimate Communion with <hi>wicked</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom he would not have Believers to walk in Church-fellowſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13, nor

Nay he would have ſuch to <hi>turn away</hi> from thoſe who do Deny the Power of Godlineſs, although they have it's Form, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>They who put no Difference (in point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Communion) between the Vile and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, do give but a bad Evidence of their being men after God's own heart. What then may we think of them, all whoſe Delight is in men of a Lighter Spirit, and who do Deſpiſe them moſt, that are moſt Excellent? Promiſcuous Intermixtures in Marriages, was that which uſhered in the Deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 4, 5: and Chriſt ſorely <hi>threatneth</hi> ſome of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, becauſe of their Impure Communion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. 20: nor have any Right unto God's Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle (which was a Type of Goſpel fellowſhip) who do not Honour thoſe that <hi>fear</hi> the Lord, Contemning others, <hi>pſa.</hi> 15. 1. 4: and Wrath was upon <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> becauſe he Loved them that Hated God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2, or becauſe he made Affinity with wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and Helped the Ungodly, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 18. 1, 2. And though this holy Curioſity hath been Deſpiſed by the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> or by Men of <hi>Saul</hi>'s temper; yet will it come in Requeſt again, as <hi>David's</hi> Tabernacle ſhall be more fully reared up.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>David</hi> was Spiritually very <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefull,</hi> in a way of Inſtructing and Encouraging others, from his own <hi>Experiences.</hi> He biddeth Kings and Judges to <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be Angry,</hi> Pſa. 2. 10, 11. He biddeth others to ſtand in

He opened his Mouth in Parables, and left upon Record behind him, what he had <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>known,</hi> for the Benefit of future Generations, <hi>pſ.</hi> 78. 2, 3, 4. He preached Righteouſneſs, and did not Refrain his Lips; he Declared the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Faithfulneſs, Salvation, Loving-kindneſs and Truth of God, and did not Hide them in his heart (in a Concealing way) from the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>pſa.</hi> 40. 9, 10. He Exhorteth all ſorts of men, who have been Relieved in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, to Praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs and wonderfull Works, <hi>pſa.</hi> 107. 2, <hi>viz.</hi> Captives, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, Sick-men, <hi>v.</hi> 17, Sea-men, <hi>v.</hi> 23, and others.

He calleth upon Saints to fear the Lord, <hi>pſa.</hi> 34. 9; and biddeth Children to come unto him, that he might teach them ſo to doe, <hi>v.</hi> 11; and laboureth to make the Brutiſh underſtand, <hi>pſa.</hi> 94. 8, and would have All to hear Chriſt's voyce <hi>To Day,</hi> and not to <hi>harden their hearts,</hi> as heretofore, <hi>pſal.</hi> 95. 7, 8. He would have upright hearts to Rejoyce in God, <hi>pſal.</hi> 32. 11; and <hi>patiently</hi> to wait upon him, <hi>pſ.</hi> 27. 14, who will ſtrengthen their Heart that Hope in him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 31. 24.</p>
            <p>So alſo when <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he Preached Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20, and kept back nothing that was Profitable, but taught the People both <hi>publickly,</hi> and <hi>from houſe to houſe,</hi>

            <p>Grace is ſelf-propagating as well as Sin; and according to what is in the Heart, the Mouth will ſpeak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 35. Thoſe give but a bad evidence of their being like unto <hi>David,</hi> who can Diſcourſe of any thing more freely, than of what is Spiritual; which ſpeaketh ſadly unto our Dumb Profeſſors, who ſcarce know how to get out a ſavoury word, when at any time they doe conferre together.

            <p n="19">19. When <hi>David</hi> was Perſonally moſt Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet was he then mindfull of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Intereſt, and was not wholly taken up with his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. When himſelf was Deſolate, <hi>pſal.</hi> 25. 16, and when the Troubles of his Heart were much Enlarged, <hi>v.</hi> 17, becauſe of his Sin and Suffering, <hi>v.</hi> 18; yet doth he Conclude with Prayer for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Redemption out of all his Troubles, <hi>v.</hi> 22. When he was ready to goe down into the Pit, <hi>pſa.</hi> 28. 1, he yet forgot not to pray, that God would <hi>ſave</hi> his People, and Lift them up for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Nay when his Bones were broken, by reaſon of the Greateſt Fall that ever he met with, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 8, yet did he then remember <hi>Sion,</hi> and prayed for the Building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 28. Nay when he lay upon his Death-bed, as his laſt words did evidence his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102526:129"/> Publick Spirit, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. 3; ſo his Laſt Prayer, <hi>pſa.</hi> 72. 20, was chiefly for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Intereſt (as the whole Body of that Pſalm doth ſhew) though in the Perſon of his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> v. 1.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſonal Afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, did not make him to ceaſe Caring for the Churches, <hi>v.</hi> 28; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that General bad Example which others did therein ſet before him, who All ſought their <hi>own,</hi> and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, is not of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit,</hi> but his Affections are like Springs, whoſe Waters ſerve in Common. He preferreth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above his Chiefeſt Joy, <hi>pſa.</hi> 137. 6; and he is more Grieved with the loſs of God's Ark, than with the Death of his neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as <hi>Eli</hi> was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 17, 18, and his Daughter, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. 22. They who can Solace themſelves in their Cieled Houſes, when God's Houſe lieth waſte, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 4, are onely called <hi>This People,</hi> v. 2, but not <hi>the People of the Lord;</hi> and ſuch as Mourn not for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> do neither Love her, nor ſhall Rejoyce for Joy with her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 10.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>David</hi> did Rejoyce in the Graces of others, and Mourned for their Sins. He was Glad, when they talked of Going up into the Houſe of God, to Serve and Worſhip him; <hi>pſa.</hi> 122. 1; and he rejoyced with great Joy, for that the People Offered Willingly unto the Building of his Temple, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 9, Bleſſing God before them all, <hi>v.</hi> 10, for what he had then
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102526:129"/> ſeen with Joy, <hi>v.</hi> 17. But he was Grieved, when he beheld Tranſgreſſors, becauſe they kept not Gods Word, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 158; and Horrour did therefore take hold upon him, <hi>v.</hi> 53; whoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections did burſt out into Rivers of Tears, upon that account, <hi>v.</hi> 136, and whoſe Zeal had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed him, not ſo much becauſe ſuch were his Enemies, as becauſe his Enemies had <hi>forgotten</hi> the Words of God, <hi>v.</hi> 139.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> did Bewail the <hi>Chrinthians</hi> Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21; and wrote with <hi>tears</hi> concerning the Enemies of Chriſt's Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18; who had great Heavineſs and <hi>continual</hi> ſorrow in his heart for poor hard-hearted <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9. 2. 4; for whom he heartily Prayed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1, and <hi>laboured</hi> if by any means he might provoke them to Emulation, that ſo ſome of them might be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 14. He alſo gave Thanks to God with much Rejoycing, when he heard of Others, as to their Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7; Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8; and Bounty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11, or Faith and Love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 15, 16, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3, 4: giving Profeſſors to underſtand, that their ſtedfaſtneſs was his Life, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Fall would be his Death, at leaſt-wiſe in point of Comfort, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any Outward Fruit, which doth more clearly Demonſtrate a work of Grace within, than thus to be Affected towards Others, upon a Spiritual account. A meer Carnal man may ſelfiſhly rejoyce or mourn, becauſe of Another's Sin or Duty, by which Himſelf is ſome way Prejudiced or Advantaged: but He is a man after God's own heart, who grieveth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102526:130"/> of God's Diſhonour, and joyeth in his being Glorified by Others as well as by Himſelf: According to which Rule of Judging, how few are there of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit? and how unlike are they to him, who vex at thoſe that do Out-ſtrip them, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12; who have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that are as bad as themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32, which is one Mark of a Reprobate, <hi>v.</hi> 28; and eſpecially ſuch, who do Compell men to ſin, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this is the Summe of what the Scriptures witneſs, concerning <hi>David</hi>'s Perſonal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice or Carriage toward the <hi>Creature:</hi> which is the Firſt Part of the Second Branch of that Outward Demonſtration that he gave of his being a man after God's own Heart.</p>
            <p>From whence I ſhall now proceed unto the Second Part, or Top-ſtone of this Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to ſhew how <hi>David</hi> did evidence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſuch a one, by his <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> in a more immediate way of Communion with him, or reſpect unto him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi>'s holy Carriage towards <hi>God,</hi> was manifeſted both in Relation unto <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In relation to Sin: and ſo he appeared to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102526:130"/> be a man after God's own heart, in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> was an utter Enemy unto <hi>Idolatry:</hi> in which reſpect, <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> is ſaid to walk in the firſt wayes of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and not to ſeek unto <hi>Baalim,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. 3; which is not to be underſtood in a way of comparing <hi>David</hi>'s Firſt and Laſt wayes together, (as if he did at laſt Degenerate) but onely in a way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>David</hi>'s wayes (which were <hi>firſt)</hi> with the Idolatrous wayes of his Sons and Succeſſors; for <hi>David</hi> himſelf was Zealous againſt Idolatry unto his Laſt. He knew that their Sorrows ſhall be multiplyed that haſten after Another God; and therefore he neither would offer their Drink-offerings of Blood, nor take up their Names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Lips, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. 4. And when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> he did not convert the Images (which they had left) to other uſes, but he and his men did Burn them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 21, <hi>viz.</hi> his Men did ſo, by his Command, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> was an utter Enemy to all <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious</hi> or <hi>falſe Worſhip.</hi> His Spirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were wholly given to <hi>Idolatry, Act.</hi> 17. 16. He bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſtians to take heed of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Idolatry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7, whoſe Golden Calf was not the Terminating Object of their Worſhip, but only the Mean by which they worſhipped the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 5; which therefore fitly anſwereth unto mens Inventions in God's Worſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. 8. He would not have Profeſſors to <hi>touch</hi> the Unclean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, by Sitting in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102526:131"/> an Idol-temple, at that Good meat which had been Polluted by ſome Idolatrous Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-going, ſince they which ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the Sacrifices, are alſo Partakers of the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18, 19, 20, 21: which fitly anſwereth to thoſe Good Sermons that may be made in Idol-temples, as ſpiritual Feaſts, to keep up the Reputation of thoſe places and of the ſuperſtitious Worſhip performed in them, in a way of provoking the Lord to Jealouſie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 22. Nor would <hi>Paul</hi> have Chriſtians to eat that Meat (although it's Property were now Altered) if any told them, that it had been formerly offered unto Idols, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25. 28: the full Myſtical extent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let others ſtudy. Nay <hi>Paul</hi> would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that Love-Feaſts ſhould be added to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> leſt they ſhould be (in time) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Part of Chriſt's Inſtitution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22, 23; nor would he have ſuch (in matters of Religious Worſhip) to Intrude into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things which God had not Commanded, or which they had not Seen, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they <hi>hold not the Head,</hi> ver. 19, who yield Subjection (in the matters of God) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men's Doctrines or Prohibitions, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22.</p>
            <p>From all which we may obſerve, that Men of <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit, will not Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date with Superſtition. They are for the utter Annihilation of Images, and not for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing onely. They are not free to keep up the Names of Idols, by which our Dayes and Moneths are Heatheniſhly called. They will have no Communion with Man's Inventions in God's
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102526:131"/> Service, under any pretenſe whatever. They will not come within the Doors of an Idol-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to eat the beſt Spiritual Feaſt there, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Groſſer Superſtition ſhould firſt be over. They will not conſult for the Maintaining of Chriſtian Love, by hazarding the Purity of Chriſt's Appointments They count Subjection to Mans Religious Prohibitions or Commands, to be a Beheading of Chriſt, who is their Onely Law giver in matters of that Nature. Such as make light of theſe things which God is ſo Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of, do give a bad Proof of their being Men after his own heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> did carefully Keep himſelf from that which was <hi>His Iniquity,</hi> by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; and as a Proof of his being Upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, <hi>pſa.</hi> 18. 23.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> doth in a more Eſpecial manner bid, that we ſhould lay aſide that Sin which doth <hi>moſt Eaſily Beſet us,</hi> Heb. 12. 1. A more <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Beſetting Sin,</hi> is that which may Eminently be called <hi>Ours;</hi> which a man after God's own Heart doth Keep himſelf from, with utmoſt care. He diligently obſerveth the Age of his Life, the Temper of his Conſtitution, and the Nature of his Particular Calling or Outward Condition; every of which may Betray him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of ſome Predominant Temptation; and having found by ſad Experience, that ſuch a Particular Temptation (by his Oft being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with it) is in a more Peculiar manner <hi>His,</hi> he chiefly ſtudyeth to Preſerve himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from accordingly. He knoweth that Ordinary <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Luſts will ſoon Run, if their <hi>Goliah</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:102526:132"/> be once conquered, and therefore he firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth with this Champion, and ceaſeth not untill he hath Overcome him. He knoweth, that His Sin is the Old man's Fat and Blood, which the Lord doth more eſpecially require, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. 27, and therefore he will ſacrifice it to him. He knoweth, that moſt Profeſſors do Plead for this, and therefore he will not Spare it, that ſo he might doe ſomething ſingular, or More than others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 47.</p>
            <p>They who are ſenſible, that ſome Corruption or other is eminently <hi>Their Iniquity,</hi> and who do yet Indulge it, becauſe it doth more eaſily Beſet them; do ſadly evidence their not being Upright before the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> did not <hi>wickedly Depart</hi> from his God, but Kept his wayes, and did not Put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Statutes from him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18. 21, 22: as having ſeen their Deſtruction, who went <hi>a Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> from him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 73. 27; and Knowing, that God would l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor did <hi>Paul</hi> Draw back unto Perdition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39, but kept the Faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7: as knowing, what is and will be the ſad por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Backſliders, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6, &amp; 10, 26, 27, 38.</p>
            <p>Indeed every the leaſt Tranſgreſſion is ſome kind of Drawing back or Departing from the Lord; but to do ſo <hi>wicked<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> or unto Perdition, doth import ſome Greater miſcariage, either as to the Matter or Manner of ſuch a Failing; in both which reſpects, a man after Gods own
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102526:132"/> heart is not thus guilty. He may come ſhort of his Duty, through ſimple Ignorance of the Truth; but yet he is not of thoſe who doe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt the Light, Job 34. 13. He may be forced from the true Worſhip and ſervice of God, as <hi>David</hi> was, in his flight from <hi>Saul;</hi> but yet he will not then go and ſerve other Gods, though others bid him doe ſo, as they did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 19. He may for a while Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his Poſitive witneſſing unto ſome Goſpel-Truths, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes did, becauſe of others weakneſs; but yet he will not act unto the Prejudice thereof, as did the falſe Apoſtles. He may depart from ſome Leſſer Truths, but not from what are of greater moment, <hi>viz.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fundamentals, or the Predominant Truths of ſuch a Time. Or when he doth Backſlide in any principal reſpect, he timely returneth with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which is enought to ſalve the truth of this Poſition, that a man after Gods own heart, doth not Wickedly Depart from him, or Draw back unto Perdition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> did Reſolve, that he would ſet no wicked thing before his eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 3. His Sin was ever before him, in a way of holy ſhame and ſorrow, <hi>pſal.</hi> 51. 3; but not in a way of ſtumbling block, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 14. 3. Indeed he once ſadly fell from the roof of his houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2; but he did not Aſcend up thither with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to fall from thence. He did not ſtir up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was provoked by Satan, to number <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. It was not in cool blood, but in his Haſte, when he ſaid, that All men (and <hi>Samuel</hi> among the reſt) were Liars, <hi>pſal.</hi> 116. 11.</p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:102526:133"/>
            <p> So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> did what he allowed not, or (as the Greek there hath it) what he knew not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15; to be ſure, what he Would not, <hi>v.</hi> 20, and what he Hated, <hi>ver.</hi> 15; which therefore could not properly be called His act, <hi>v.</hi> 17, or at leaſt wiſe not the act of his Mind, <hi>v.</hi> 23, or Will, <hi>v.</hi> 21, nor any of his Delight, <hi>v.</hi> 22; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he could not be ſaid to ſet ſin before his Eyes.</p>
            <p>A man after Gods own heart, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with the Iniquity of his Heels, in an Evil day, <hi>pſal.</hi> 49. 5; but yet he will not ſet any Iniquity before his eyes. He ſetteth before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Evil of ſuffering, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 31; but not the evil of Sin, ſave in a way of Deteſtation, or Arming of himſelf againſt it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12, 13. He may be overtaken with a fault, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1; but his feet doe not Run after Evil, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 7. He may be ſold under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14; but he doth not ſell himſelf to work evil, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 20. His ſoil may bring forth Thorns and Briars; but ſuch things are not of his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> made conſcience of his very words and Thoughts; both which he did deſire, not onely that they might be Accepted, but alſo that they might be Acceptable; and in the ſight of God, <hi>pſ.</hi> 19. 14. He was Purpoſed that his Mouth ſhould not Tranſgreſs, <hi>pſa.</hi> 17. 3; and ſaid he would not ſin with his Tongue, but took heed unto his Words as being part of his <hi>Wayes, pſ.</hi> 39. 1. He hated Vain Thoughts, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 113; and Gods Teſtimonies were his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v.</hi> 99; whoſe eyes prevented the night-watches
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102526:133"/> that he might Meditate in the VVord of God, <hi>v.</hi> 148.</p>
            <p>So alſo; <hi>Paul</hi> put away his childiſh Thoughts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11; caſting down ſinful Imaginations, and <hi>bringing into Captivity every Thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. He would have a Chriſtians ſpeech to be alway ſavoury and Gracious, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6; and that Jeaſting or fooliſh Talking ſhould not be once Named among them as becometh Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3. 4; and that no corrupt Communication ſhould proceed out of their mouths, but that which is good to the uſe of Edifying, <hi>that it may miniſter Grace unto the Hearers, Eph.</hi> 4. 29; ſince evil Communications <hi>corrupt good Manners,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33.</p>
            <p>A Gracious heart is farr from thinking that words are wind, or that his Thoughts are free. He knoweth that his Tongue ſhould be his glory, <hi>pſ.</hi> 30. 12; and that his words are actions in the Bud, by which a man ſhall be Juſtified or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 37. He alſo knoweth, that the <hi>Thought of Fooliſhneſs is ſin,</hi> Prov. 24. 9; and that God ſearcheth the Heart, <hi>to give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his Wayes, Jer.</hi> 17. 10. Such are not after Gods own heart, who make no great matter of vain Thoughts and Idle words; which ſpeaketh ſadly unto thoſe Profeſſors, whoſe Precious Time is laviſhed away in Fooliſh Talk and Jeaſting, unto the ſhame of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>David</hi> was ſelf-ſuſpitious, who therefore deſired that God would ſearch him and know his heart, and Trie him and know his Thoughts, and ſee if there were any wicked way in him, <hi>pſa.</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:102526:134"/> 139. 23, 24. He had acknowledged before, that God was acquainted with all his wayes, <hi>v.</hi> 3, <hi>and Words, v.</hi> 4. <hi>and Thoughts, v.</hi> 2; whom now he doth deſire to prove him, as being Jealous of his own Deceitful heart, leſt he through Pride or Ignorance ſhould Overlook ſome more refined or beloved ſin. And though the Lord had formerly ſearched him, and known him, <hi>v.</hi> 1; yet doth he here deſire, that he would yet again more fully prove him. Yea though he was comfortably perſwaded, that nothing ſhould be found, <hi>pſa.</hi> 17. 3; and that he had walked in his Integrity, <hi>pſa.</hi> 26, 1, yet did he ſtill deſire, that God would Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him and Prove him, and try his <hi>reins and heart, v.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> did not Judge himſelf, and though he knew nothing by himſelf, yet did he not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Juſtifie himſelf, but he that Judged him was the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The Phariſees were of a ſelf-juſtifying diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15; but a truly Gracious heart is ſelf-ſuſpitious. He knoweth that the heart is a very Deceitful thing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10; and that God is greater than the Conſcience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20, whom he doth ſtudy to ſhew himſelf Approved unto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15, by whom he muſt be one day Judged, and whom he would therefore have to ſearch and Trie him throughly. He will not ſcornfully reject thoſe Cenſures and Reproofs, which yet he hopeth to be falſe and Groundleſs, ſuſpecting his being apt to overlook that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which another may more readily diſcern. Although his Conſcience doth acquit him, yet will he put it upon a freſh enquiry, until he hath the

He doth the Truth, and yet he cometh to the Light, that ſo his Deeds may be made Manifeſt, that they are wrought in God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21. Nor doth he thus deſire to be ſearched, becauſe he thinketh all is well, as that young man did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 20; or meerly beauſe he feared an exacter Scrutiny at Chriſts Tribunal; but becauſe he would rectifie what is amiſs, and be led in the way everlaſting, <hi>pſa.</hi> 139. 24.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>David</hi> was loth to ſin through Ignorance, and therefore he deſired that God would teach him the way of his Statutes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 33, and open his eyes, <hi>v.</hi> 18, and give him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>v.</hi> 34, and ſhew him all his wayes, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 4; for which end he waited upon him all the day, <hi>v.</hi> 5, and promiſed that he then would keep Gods Law, unto the End, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 33, 34; to ſhew that he reſted not in a bare form of knowledge, but did deſire to be Inſtructed, that ſo he might not ſin.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo, when <hi>Paul</hi> was convinced, that he had Ignorantly perſecuted Chriſt, <hi>Act</hi> 9. 5, whereof his preſent Bodily blindneſs was a ſign, <hi>v.</hi> 8; he forthwith begged that he might know what he ſhould do, <hi>v.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo continued pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v.</hi> 11, until he had received his Bodily and Spiritual ſight together, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Practiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 20, according to what was Revealed in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Some men are <hi>willingly Ignorant,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5, and come not to the Light, leaſt their Deeds ſhould be Reproved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20; or when they have asked, <hi>What is the Truth?</hi> they will not

            <p n="8">8. <hi>David</hi> did Miſtruſt himſelf, and therefore he Beſought the Lord, that he might not be Led into Temptation, by being enclined to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 36, or <hi>any Evil thing,</hi> Pſa. 141. 4.

            <p>Men of a Tender Conſcience are oft-times Doubly wronged; Partly, in that the Matter of their Scruple is judged <hi>ſmall,</hi> which (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſuch a Time) is uſually <hi>Greater</hi> than the other are aware of; and Partly, becauſe they are thought to ſtrain at Gnats, and to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Camels.

            <p n="11">11. <hi>David</hi> knew his own <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired that God would undertake to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> him from Temptations of a ſinful Nature.

He knew

He carefully ſtored up what Preſervatives he met with in the Scripture, and laboured to <hi>work</hi> them upon his heart by Holy Meditation. And when he had received an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe from God, that his Mercy ſhould not Depart from his Son, as it did from <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 15, and that his Houſe ſhould be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for Ever, <hi>v.</hi> 16; he did not hereupon Preſume, unto the Neglect of Means, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell to Prayer, that God would do as he had ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, and did therefore put up that Prayer, becauſe of the former Promiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>So alſo, though God had given <hi>Paul</hi> all them that Sailed with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 24, ſo that he verily Believed, <hi>v.</hi> 25, there ſhould be no loſs of any man's Life, <hi>v.</hi> 22; yet did he tell the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they could not be Saved, except the Sea-men did continue with them, who were the Ordinary Means of that Aſſured Preſervation, <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. And though he did Believe, that God would Deliver him from Every <hi>evil work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 18; yet did he Run and Fight and keep his Body under, leſt he ſhould be a Caſt-away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27: Who alſo exhorted thoſe <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> to work out their Salvation <hi>with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12, though he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their Own utter Inſufficiency thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>v.</hi> 13, and though he was Confident, that God would Perform in them whatever Good work he had Begun, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>A gracious heart doth ſo Depend upon the

            <p n="13">13. <hi>David</hi> was glad, when he was ſtopped in an Evil and ſinfull way.

            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> evidenced himſelf to be of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> Spirit, by ſtopping in his full Career of Perſecution, upon Chriſt's Call, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had Threatned Slaughter, <hi>v.</hi> 1, and

            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> was Enraged, when Diſappointed in his Deſign to Kill good <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 17: but a man after God's own heart Rejoyceth, when his unlawful Devices are not brought to paſs. He onely Mourneth over ſuch Attempts, and Bleſſeth God as heartily for Hedging up Hell's way with Thorns, as for Enlargement in his way to Heaven. Nor doth he thus to Pacifie his Luſt, when he cannot Satisfie it; but from the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his Heart, which would not ſin; and evidenceth it, by endeavouring to Kill that Root, whoſe Budding Fruits the Lord hath Blaſted. Nor is he thus Glad, in ſome Particular Caſe onely, as <hi>Darius</hi> was, in the caſe of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6. 23; but he doth Alway Bleſs God for ſuch Defeats, and improveth thoſe Rebukes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more ſtrict ſearch into the Nature of what he could not ſo clearly ſee, whileſt under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Temptation.</p>

            <p>A Gracious heart is very Tender, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 34. 27; and ſuch a one is apt to Bluſh, at the very Mentioning of ſome Sins, yea though himſelf be not Guilty of them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6.

Nor did he ſpeak thereof in a way of Mincing it, but called it <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Pſa. 51. 2, <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> v. 3, <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> Pſa. 38. 5, <hi>Evil Indeed,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 17; and ſtyleth himſelf a <hi>very Beaſt,</hi> becauſe of his ſimple Envy, <hi>pſa.</hi> 73. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> freely confeſſed, that he had

Nor did he ſpeak here of in a Mincing way, but therefore calleth himſelf a <hi>Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, Injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13, and <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mad,</hi> Act. 26. 11.</p>
            <p>Some men will rather Die, than Confeſs a fault; but the Diſtempers of a Godly man break out at his Lips, which is a Means to ſave his Life. He will not Cover his Tranſgreſſions, like <hi>Adam, Job</hi> 31. 33, as knowing the dolefull Effects of ſuch a Silence, <hi>pſa.</hi> 32. 3, 4, and that the Lord will have Iniquity to be Acknowledged, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 13, who then is Juſt and Faithful to forgive it, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 9. Nor doth he ſeek to Leſſen it, but ſetteth it out with all its Aggravations, as being more offended with it in Himſelf, than in Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>David</hi> was alſo very deeply Humbled for his <hi>Sin.</hi> His Life was ſpent with Grief, and his years with <hi>Sighing,</hi> his <hi>Strength</hi> failed, and his very Bones were conſumed, becauſe of his Iniquity, <hi>pſal.</hi> 31. 10.

            <p>And thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his former Evil Courſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 5, did lay it ſo to heart, as that he did neither eat nor drink of Three Dayes after, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Nor was it ſome violent Pang, but when he had obtained

            <p>Sin maketh God to crie out, <hi>I am preſſed, as a Cart that is full of Sheaves,</hi> Am. 2. 13; and therefore a man after God's own heart muſt needs Groan under it. A Saint overtaken in a fault, is out of Joynt; who therefore muſt needs be in very great Pain, untill he be Reſtored, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Sin</hi> is that Root from whence all Sufferings grow, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39; and therefore it muſt needs be a <hi>Root of Bitterneſs,</hi> Heb. 12. 15. Profeſſors ſins are of the Deepeſt Die, which therefore muſt needs Imprint accordingly upon a Tender heart. <hi>Cain</hi> complained of his Puniſhment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13; which <hi>David</hi> ſubmitted unto, and onely deſired the Lord to Take away <hi>his Sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. 17. And that which may be the Natural man's Paſſion, is the Godly man's conſtant Frame, who Mourneth all his dayes, for that which he is yet Perſwaded is Done away.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>David</hi> did chiefly mourn for <hi>Sin,</hi> as it related unto God, againſt Whom (and Him Onely) he had Sinned, as himſelf confeſſeth, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 4: Which cannot be meant, as if he thought he had not ſinn'd againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> alſo; but meerly, in competition with that Evil which he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought upon himſelf, in the Loſs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace, <hi>pſal.</hi> 51. 8. 12, the Miſery upon his Family, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10, 11. 14, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of his own Life, if the Lord himſelf had not remitted that part of his Puniſhment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13: Notwithſtanding all which Perſonal Miſchiefs procured by his Sin, he yet was <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> grieved, for that Reproach which he had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102526:140"/> thereby brought upon the <hi>Great Name</hi> of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14, who had been ſo <hi>Good</hi> to him, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8: and therefore he thus confeſſeth here, <hi>Againſt Thee, Thee Onely, have I ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth not tell us what ſorrows he had brought upon himſelf, but onely that he had done many things contrary to the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Act.</hi> 26. 9, abuſing them who did believe on <hi>Him,</hi> and conſenting unto the Death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> whom he calleth <hi>His</hi> Martyr, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 19, 20; which is in effect as if he had uttered <hi>David</hi>'s words before mentioned.</p>
            <p>They who truely <hi>fear</hi> the Lord, are alſo ſaid to <hi>think</hi> upon his <hi>Name, Mal.</hi> 3. 16; the Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring whereof by <hi>Sin,</hi> is that which chiefly woundeth a Gracious Heart. And therefore it is, that ſuch are ever after, moſt Zealous for this Name of God, as <hi>David</hi> was, who Knew it, <hi>pſa.</hi> 91. 14; and did Remember it, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 55; accounting it Holy and Reverend, <hi>pſal.</hi> 111. 9; deſigning to build a Temple to it, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22. 7; calling his own Advancement by it, <hi>pſa.</hi> 75. 1; deſiring to <hi>fear</hi> it, <hi>pſa.</hi> 86. 11; deſcribing true Saints by their Love unto it, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 132; mourning becauſe of its being Blaſphemed, <hi>pſa.</hi> 74. 10; and Praying for himſelf, that ſo this Name of God might be Magnified, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 25, 26, and Againſt others, that they might ſeek it, <hi>pſ.</hi> 83. 16.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>David</hi> did look upon his Outward <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to be the Fruit of Sin; and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth that all his Sins might be forgiven, in order unto the Removal of his Affliction, <hi>pſa.</hi> 25. 18; confeſſing that his wounds did ſtink, becauſe of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102526:141"/> his Fooliſhneſs, <hi>pſal.</hi> 38. 5; and calling his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evils by the Name of their Father, <hi>viz.</hi> His Iniquities, <hi>pſa.</hi> 40. 12, or the Iniquity of his Heels, <hi>pſa.</hi> 49. 5, which had gone over his Head, and were a Burden too heavy for him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 38. 4, becauſe they were the Original of all his Sufferings. And though Men did hate him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cauſe, ſeeking to deſtroy him Wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and making him to Reſtore what he had not Taken, <hi>pſa.</hi> 69. 4; yet even then did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that God Knew his Fooliſhneſs, and that his Sins were not hid from him, <hi>v.</hi> 5; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth his being ſenſible, that he had Deſerved thoſe Sufferings from the Lord, though not from the hands of Men.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that Death is Sins Wages, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23; and therefore (Partly) doth he call his own Sin, a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> Ro. 7. 24. Nay when himſelf and others were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by Man for Chriſt's ſake, yet doth he call thoſe very Perſecutions, fatherly Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Corrections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4, 5. 9; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto us, that a Gracious heart is ſo far from charging God fooliſhly, when he doth at any time Rebuke for <hi>Sin,</hi> as that he doth charge himſelf with Meriting at the hand of God, that which Man doth unjuſtly lay upon him for the ſake of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>David</hi> was duely ſenſible of Old Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; deſiring that God would not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſins of his <hi>Youth,</hi> Pſa. 25. 7; and humbly confeſſing that Original Iniquity wherein he was <hi>ſhapen</hi> and <hi>conceived,</hi> Pſa. 51. 5.</p>
            <p>So alſo, when <hi>Paul</hi> was Aged, yet he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102526:141"/> ſtill, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 10, what he had done amiſs when Young, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 58. Nor did he think, that Infants are acquitted from the Guilt of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, but proveth the quite contrary; becauſe Death reigned over them that had not ſinned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. Nor did himſelf Forget what God had long ſince Pardoned; but after that he had obtained Mercy, he ſtill confeſſeth his former Injuries that he had done, as well as his Groſſer failings and miſcarriages, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>A Gracious heart hath All his Treſpaſſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13; but yet he will not forgive any of them to himſelf, ſo as to be forgetfull of them. Nor is he ſatisfied with confeſſing them Once for all, but maketh that his Conſtant work, which others count Needleſs, becauſe it hath been done before. He humbly forgetteth that Duty which is Behind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13; but though he putteth away his Childiſh things, in point of repeated Action; yet doth he Confeſs them ſtill, in a way of Continued ſelf-humiliation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>David</hi> did ſee, that he ſtood in need of being Cleanſed from <hi>ſecret Faults,</hi> and from thoſe Errours, which he (through Ignorance) could not underſtand, <hi>pſa.</hi> 19. 12.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> doth acknowledge his need of Pardoning Mercy, for what he did Ignorantly in Unbelief, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, nay though he ſometimes verily though it had been his Duty, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9. And though he Knew Nothing by himſelf, yet was he not thereby Juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4; which clearly intimateth a Poſſibility of his being to be
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102526:142"/> Condemned, for that which he (through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) might not be able to underſtand.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Lawfulneſs of an Action, into his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Light; nor doth he conclude, it is no ſin, meerly becauſe he Thinketh it not to be ſo. He knoweth, that ſins of Ignorance were to be Sacrificed for of Old, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 13, 14. 22; and that there is but One Faith or Rule of Life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5, which every one (within the compaſs of it's knowledge) is firſt bound to underſtand, and then to practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. And though an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Scruple may ſtop a Lawfull action, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23; yet he that Knew not his Maſters will, and did commit things worthy of Stripes, is liable to be Beaten, although with <hi>fewer</hi> Stripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. And therefore a Gracious heart will both Acknowledge thoſe Errours which he doth not Particularly underſtand, and beggeth to be Cleanſed from thoſe faults which may be <hi>ſecret</hi> to himſelf as well as others.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſumme of <hi>David</hi>'s Grace-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing Carriage towards God, in relation unto <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then Secondly; <hi>David</hi> did evidence his being a man after God's own Heart, by the Conſtancy of his <hi>Carriage,</hi> in relation to that <hi>Poſitive Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which he did more immediately perform unto the Lord: And that both in reſpect of <hi>Paſſive</hi> and <hi>Active</hi> Duty.</p>
            <pb n="281" facs="tcp:102526:142"/>
            <p> Firſt, in reſpect of <hi>Paſſive</hi> Duty, or of that Suffering-ſervice which he was put upon for Goodneſs ſake. And ſo we read, not only that he was Patient then, <hi>pſa.</hi> 38. 12, 13, 14; but alſo (which is very ſtrange, conſidering the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he lived under) that he rejoyced to doe the Will of God, when called forth to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for him, or to be Offered up Himſelf, in the ſtead of thoſe ſubſtituted Legal Sacrifices, which did but ſhadow out his kind of Suffering ſervice, <hi>pſ.</hi> 40. 6, 7, 8, wherein he was a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. Which Perſecutions of his are largely handled in his two and twentieth Pſalm; and yet he ſtyleth that Pſalm (as its Title ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>Aijel Shachar,</hi> or the <hi>Hind of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> to ſignifie, with what Inward Chearfulneſs he went about that Suffering-duty, as if he had been an Hind, whoſe feet are noted for their Nimbleneſs, or skipping up on High, <hi>pſal.</hi> 18. 33, eſpecially in the Morning.</p>
            <p>In which regard, <hi>Paul</hi> doth more Plainly tell us, that he was not Aſhamed of his Sufferings, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12, but did Rejoyce in being Offered upon the Sacrifice and Service of others Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 17; and was Ready both to be Bound and Die for the Name of <hi>Jeſus, Act.</hi> 21. 13, ſo ſoon as he had heard thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 11; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Gift to <hi>ſuffer</hi> as well as to <hi>believe, Phil.</hi> 1. 29; and not onely ſo, but he did alſo Glory in his Tribulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, and deſired to Glory in Nothing elſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14; being chiefly ambitious of Knowing the fellowſhip of Chriſt's Sufferings, and of being made Conformable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:102526:143"/>
            <p> A Gracious Heart may <hi>Crie,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>pſal.</hi> 22. 2; eſpecially if ſeemingly forſaken upon the Croſs, as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>v.</hi> 1: but yet he Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up that Croſs more Chearfully than if it were an Earthly Crown. He doth not put others upon Suffering, that ſo himſelf might be Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts did by their Sheep and Oxen, who Died in their Sacrificers ſtead: but he is willing to bear the <hi>Croſs Alone,</hi> and to Eaſe others of that Burden, as Chriſt was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 8. He doth Preferre his Duty before his outward Intereſt; and doth Delight to do this Will of God, ſo ſoon as it appeareth (from the Volume of his Book) to be God's Will that he ſhould <hi>ſuffer.</hi> And thus he doth evidence himſelf to be a man after God's own heart (as <hi>David</hi> was) by the tenour of his Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in reſpect of <hi>Paſſive Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> did evidence himſelf to be ſuch a one, in a way of <hi>Active</hi> Duty alſo; as will appear, firſt in the General thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen. David</hi> did not Reſt in <hi>Legal Duties,</hi> but Preſſed after what was of a more Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Spiritual Nature. He knew that Incenſe was but a Type of Prayer; and therefore he deſired that his <hi>Prayer</hi> might be ſet forth before the Lord as <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and the Lifting up of his Hands as the Evening Sacrifice, <hi>pſa.</hi> 141. 2. He knew that <hi>Praiſes</hi> would pleaſe the Lord better than an Oxe or Bullock; and therefore he would Magnifie him with <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> Pſa. 69. 30, 31. He knew that the Sacrifices of God are a <hi>broken Spirit;</hi> and that he did not deſire <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102526:143"/> was delighted in <hi>Burnt-Offering,</hi> Pſalm. 51. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> knew that Legal Holineſs was onely <hi>ſhadowy;</hi> and therefore he was for putting on the <hi>New Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and True Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. He knew that Legal Circumciſion was Nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19; and therefore he was for Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>Letter,</hi> Rom. 2. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29. He knew that the <hi>who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Law</hi> was Dead, (ſo far as it was Onely given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Enlivened by his Authority) that we ſhould ſerve in <hi>Newneſs of Spirit, and not in the Oldneſs of the Letter,</hi> Rom. 7. 6; and therefore he doth Diſgracefully call thoſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſioniſts, Phil.</hi> 3. 2, who ſtill Boaſted of their Legal Priviledges or Duties, <hi>v.</hi> 4, which himſelf had counted Loſs for Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>A Gracious Heart is not ſatisfied with Legal Sacrifices, or with ſuch Duties now, as thoſe Sacrifices were of Old; becauſe he knoweth, that the Lord is not pleaſed with them.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were ancient Ceremonial Laws, which onely were Impoſed untill the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> Heb. 9. 10: now a Goſpel-Saint is not for the Keeping up of ancient Ceremonies, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were onely the <hi>Shadows</hi> of Good things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1: now a Gracious heart is not ſatisfied with a meer Form of Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5, or <hi>ſhew</hi> of Grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were <hi>Leſſer</hi> things when at the <hi>Beſt;</hi> which therefore (Comparatively) the Lord ſaith, he <hi>Never</hi> did command, <hi>Jerem.</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:102526:144"/> 7. 22, 23: now a Gracious heart is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Leſſer Duties, in the neglect of Greater, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 23.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were Bloody things, which therefore had a ſhew of Cruelty: now a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart is not Taken with that pretended Piety, which croſſeth the Rule of Charity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs Word requiring it; becauſe he knoweth, that God <hi>will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> Matt. 9. 13.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were wont to be Accounted of, meerly according to their Number, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 63: but a Gracious Heart is not ſatisfied, with Praying ſo Oft, or Hearing ſo Many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Reading ſo many Chapters in a Day; becauſe he knoweth, that <hi>Good Actions</hi> ſevered from <hi>ſpiritual Affections,</hi> are but like unto the Skin of a Sacrifice ſtuffed out with ſtraw.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were after-Duties, in a way of Satisfaction for ſome Former failing; or in a way of Doing for Life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12: now a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heart doth know, that he cannot Doe for God, beyond what is his bounden Duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10; and therefore he doth not Act in a way of ſuppoſed Satisfaction or Deſerving, but onely of Obedience.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were Deputed in the ſtead of Others, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 11. 15, who ſhould have ſupplyed that place themſelves, according unto ſtrict and proper Juſtice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17: now a Gracious Heart will bind no Burdens upon <hi>others</hi> (in a way of Doing or Suffering) which he is not willing to Bear <hi>himſelf,</hi> as did the <hi>Phariſees, Matt.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
            <pb n="285" facs="tcp:102526:144"/>
            <p> Legal Sacrifices were Cuſtomarily Repeated, without Effecting what they were uſed for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2: now a Gracious Heart is not ſatisfied with that Learning which never comes to the Knowledge of the Truth; or with that Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Endeth not in the Forſaking of his Sin; or with any other Religious Duty, which tendeth not unto Perfection.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were performed by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the help of any <hi>ſupernatural Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> now a Gracious heart is not ſatisfied with what he is able to doe, by virtue of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Strength; unleſs that Fleſh be Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of Chriſt, that ſo he may Offer up <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Legal Sacrifices were ſuch as meer Carnal <hi>Jews</hi> did ſometimes Abound in the performance of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 11: but a Gracious heart is for Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripping others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 47; and is not Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſs his Righteouſneſs doth Exceed that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> v. 20.</p>
            <p>From all which, we may obſerve, that <hi>ſuch</hi> are not men after God's own Heart, who are for the keeping up of Abrogated Ceremonies; who are for <hi>Shadows</hi> without the <hi>Subſtance;</hi> who are for <hi>Leſſer</hi> things, with the Neglect of <hi>Greater;</hi> whoſe Religion is ſtained with <hi>Cruelty;</hi> who place their Holineſs in the Number of their Performances; who gather Satisfaction from what they doe, for what they have done Amiſs; who do Tranſlate unpleaſing Duty from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to others; who do not <hi>Thrive</hi> and <hi>Grow</hi> by what they do converſe about; who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102526:145"/> with what a meer <hi>Natural</hi> man can doe, and with what the Generality of Profeſſors doe attain unto. Thus much in the <hi>General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particu:</hi> But then <hi>David</hi> alſo did more <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> diſcover that he was a man after God's own heart (with reference unto his <hi>Active</hi> Duty towards God) in theſe following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> evidenced very much of a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit, in relation to God's more Immediate <hi>Corrections.</hi> He did humbly Commit his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into God's hand, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31. 5: chooſing rather to fall into his hand, than into the hand of Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14: eying him in <hi>Shimei</hi>'s Curſing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10: giving Him leave to do with him what ſeemed good unto him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26: acknowledging that God was Holy, although he did not hear his Cry, <hi>pſa.</hi> 22. 2, 3; and that he was to be Juſtified (as being Clear) when he Judged, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 4: and Bleſſing the Lord for Evermore, with a Two-fold <hi>Amen, pſa.</hi> 89. 52, when himſelf was ſeemingly Abhorred, <hi>v.</hi> 38, and his Covenant made void, <hi>v.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> laid his Liberty and Life at God's ſeet, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 13: acknowledging him Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when moſt <hi>ſevere, Rom.</hi> 3. 5: whoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation made him Patient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3: who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Sufferings from Man, as being the Will of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36: and who abounded in Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 3, even then when his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abounded alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Let all Impatient Spirits know, that a man after God's own Heart is of another Diſpoſition.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102526:145"/> He may complain <hi>To God,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>pſa.</hi> 22. 1; but not <hi>Of God,</hi> as did <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 13. He would not be Rebuked in Wrath, <hi>pſal.</hi> 38. 1; but yet he is in Subjection when Corrected, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9; and openeth not his mouth, becauſe God doth it, <hi>pſa.</hi> 39. 9. He could be glad if God would Speedily deliver him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 31. 2; but yet his Eyes Wait upon the Lord, until he ſhall have mercy on him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 123. 2.

               <hi>v.</hi> 23; though one would have thought, his firſt Commiſſion might have ſufficed, or rather no freſh Order at all, to fight with them, whom God had of Old commanded to be Deſtroyed, although they did not Begin the quarrel, as here they did, <hi>v.</hi> 17.

He will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed from the Lord, before he will Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Difficulties, or Flee from Dangers, or ſatisfie his Deſires.

            <p>For the better underſtanding whereof, it muſt be noted, that <hi>David</hi> himſelf was an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Type, Primarily of Chriſt, and Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily of thoſe who are Chriſt's, <hi>viz.</hi> his Saints and People; whether theſe Saints be Collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, (ſo <hi>David</hi>'s compleated Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom ſhadowed out their Portion under the Seventh Trumpet,) or whether they be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually conſidered; and ſo his Reigning ſtate did ſhadow out every of their ſpiritual portions in all Goſpel-Ages; which latter I ſhall now onely proſecute, and briefly touch the other in the cloſe of this Particular.</p>
            <p>Now then, as <hi>David</hi> at this time had his Friends and Adverſaries, ſo alſo hath every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Saint his Friends and Enemies, from whom he gaineth (as did <hi>David)</hi> ſeveral Gifts and Spoils, which are accordingly improved, though in a more myſterious way.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>Toi</hi> the King of <hi>Hamath</hi> for his Friend, who was a poor Creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>David,</hi> yet friendly and not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus alſo each Saint is alway furniſhed with ſuch a Friend, <hi>viz.</hi> the Remainder of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s good Nature in him; which is a poor low thing compared with Chriſt in him, but yet 'tis very Friendly, and not to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>Toi</hi> the King of <hi>Hamath</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>David</hi> with Silver, Gold and Braſs. And
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102526:151"/> thus alſo, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s good Nature doth furniſh each Saint, with ſome kind of Golden Knowledge, and Silver like Peace, and with the Braſs of Outward Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Eſteem, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Influence, all which are uſefull, although Inferiour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> alſo had his Enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Philiſtines, Amalekites</hi> and <hi>Syrians;</hi> which <hi>Syrians</hi> do ſeem at that time to have been One with the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as being near of Kindred, the one coming from <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and the other from <hi>Aram,</hi> who were the two Sons of <hi>Shem, Gen.</hi> 10. 22. And thus alſo each Saint hath his <hi>ſpiritual Enemies,</hi> reſembling thoſe before-mentioned, with reſpect unto what thoſe are chiefly noted for in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which I have formerly hinted, and ſhall here briefly recapitulate.</p>
            <p>As for Example:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Edomites</hi> came of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who is chiefly noted for the Sale of his Birthright and his loſs of Supremacy; which made him to hate his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacob</hi> ever after. And ſo thoſe <hi>Edomites</hi> do fitly reſemble the Saints Body or Outward man, which is Originally a little Elder than the Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7, and hath been a Clog unto it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27, ever ſince the ſelf-contracted Fall, before which time, the Outward man had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Name of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Happineſs, which ſince that time hath fal'n to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſhare, and ſo ſhall be to all Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi> more Spiritual, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> are chiefly noted for their being the Fruit of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102526:152"/> Inordinate deſire of Children. And ſo they fitly anſwer to thoſe Inordinate and fleſhly luſts which warre againſt the Soul, and which the Beſt are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id to take heed of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are chiefly noted for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very heart of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Land. And ſo they fitly anſwer to Boſome-ſins, which do more <hi>eaſily beſet us,</hi> Heb. 12. 1, and which therefore may be called <hi>Ours</hi> by way of Eminency, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18. 23.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Amalekites</hi> are chiefly noted for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Oppoſers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their Journey towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> And ſo they fitly anſwer to that <hi>Worldly</hi> mind, firſtly prevailing upon the true Converts Fleſhly part, which is moſt faint and ſubject to be ſmitten.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Syrians</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are chiefly noted, for their high Deſcent, <hi>(viz.</hi> from <hi>Shem)</hi> and yet their deadly hatred againſt God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from firſt to laſt. And ſo they fitly anſwer to thoſe more Diabolical Tentations, which come from Satan, who was an Angel by Creation, but (to the Saints eſpecially) is now become a roaring and devouring Lion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principal of thoſe Adverſaries, which every true Goſpel-Saint hath been and ſtill is conflicting with (in the Myſtery) as <hi>David</hi> did of Old in the Letter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>David</hi> did forcibly gain from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darezer</hi> and the reſt, their Shields of Gold, their choiceſt Silver, and very much Braſs: And in like manner, each Goſpel-Saint doth forcibly gain from Satan and his Party (by his conflicting with them) much Golden Wiſdom, (which hath
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102526:152"/> been the Old Man's Shield) much inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is of more worth than Silver; and the meaneſt part of whoſe Gain (like unto that of <hi>Hadarezer</hi>'s Braſs) hath been and ſtill is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Partly to Adorn, (as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Pillars did his Porch,) Partly to Cleanſe, (as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Brazen Sea did the Prieſts, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 4. 6;) and in ſeveral other reſpects, ſuiting with what <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s other Veſſels ſerved for; all which were made of <hi>Hadarezer</hi>'s Braſs. Little thought <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darezer</hi> and his Confederates, that they ſhould have Encreaſed <hi>David</hi>'s Treaſures, whom they intended to deſtroy: and little thinks Satan or the Old Man, that a poor Believer ſhould be Enriched by their Conflicting with him, whom they deſign to make a Spoil of: but thus God ordereth it, that <hi>Satan</hi> doth learn a Saint more Wiſdom than he had before; and Corruptions conquered do adde unto his ſtock of Comfort; and the Soul by this means is far more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Pure and Serviceable, than otherwiſe it might have been both unto God and Man. Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Tempted (though in never ſo violent a manner) may prove unto our great advantage, in caſe we overcome as <hi>David</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>David</hi> did Dedicate unto the Lord, and for the Service of his Temple, whatever Gifts and Spoils he had thus gained. Now <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Temple (in a Larger ſence) did ſhadow out Chriſt's Body, both Natural, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. 21, and Myſtical, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17; but in a Stricter ſence, that Temple was a Double Type, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the Beginning and Ending of Chriſt's Whole Diſpenſation. Firſtly, it was a Type
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102526:153"/> of that Outward Glory in Goſpel times which God beſtowed upon his Saints and Churches in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which Glory was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,)</hi> and is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again (as that of Old in the Letter was) together with the Return of that <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity. But then ultimately, or at the Laſt, that Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> did typifie that far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Glory of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lamb (whoſe Perſonal Reign was ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſhadowed out by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s) is ſaid to be the Temple of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22.</p>
            <p>In every of which reſpects, a truely Gracious heart doth Dedicate his fore-named Gifts and Spoils unto the Service of God's Temple: that is, he doth deſign to Glorifie Jeſus Chriſt, both in his Perſon and Members and Intereſts, by all that Light and Joy and other Advantages, which he at any time hath gained, from Friend or Foe. The Natural man is apt to convert ſuch things unto a <hi>ſinfull</hi> uſe, as <hi>Saul</hi> did his Revenues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtirring up of others againſt good <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 7, 8; ſuch are apt to be the more Miſchievous becauſe of their Knowledge, and yet more Preſumptuous becauſe of their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Peace, and to improve their Outward Intereſt in Satan's ſervice: and though ſome others of them be not ſo Groſs, yet do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſuch things unto a ſelfiſh uſe; purſuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knowledge in a ſelf-exalting way, deſiring inward Peace in a meer ſelf-ſatisfying way, and improving their outward Intereſt, as <hi>Saul</hi> once did his, unto the Promotion of good <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:102526:153"/> meerly becauſe he did Refreſh hi, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 21, 22, 23: and though ſome more refined Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man may Dedicate ſome part of his Spoils unto the Lord, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26. 28, yet is it onely for the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle (under which <hi>Saul</hi> lived,) which ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out ſome Lower things, (far ſhort of what the Temple typified,) ſuch as are, Natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments and Moral Vertues, and the more External part or Form of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But now a truely Gracious heart deſigneth Chriſt's Glory, by every thing he hath, or doth deſire. He magnifieth Chriſt, by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his outward Intereſt in the World; he beggeth inward Peace, that ſo he might do his Maſter the more chearful ſervice; he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Knowledge unto Practice, and would be Gracious, that ſo Chriſt might be glorified in him, rather than that himſelf ſhould be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by advantaged, as <hi>David</hi> did prepare for the glory of that Houſe, which yet himſelf foreſaw he ſhould not ſhare in. And thus he aimeth at Chriſt's advancement in every thing he doth; which will be moſt fully evident at Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, which Diſpenſation was ultimately ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by that Temple, unto the ſervice whereof <hi>David</hi> did thus Dedicate his Gifts and Spoils; and whereby he eminently did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that he was a man after God's own heart.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> did Gain much ſpiritual Gold and Silver, (or at leaſt-wiſe Braſs) not onely from his Friend, <hi>viz.</hi> the Remainder of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s good Nature in him; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102526:154"/> from his Enemies, by ſubduing his <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiſh</hi> Outward man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27; his <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiſh</hi> and <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> Inordinate Affections, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12; his <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Boſom-Luſts, which did more Eaſily beſet him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1; his <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekitiſh</hi> Worldly mind, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 33; and his <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> or Satanical Temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7: the Gain of all which Conqueſts, was Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him to an Holy Uſe, and left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the ſervice of God's Myſtical Temple, <hi>viz.</hi> his Saints and Churches; all which were Committed by him, to <hi>Timothy</hi> and other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2, (as <hi>David</hi>'s Dedicated things were to <hi>Shelomith</hi> and his Brethren, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28.) for future Uſe, and for the ſervice of a far more Glorious following Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>A man after God's own heart, doth Gain much by his Conflicting with and Overcoming Satan's Temptations and his own Diſtempers; whoſe precious Experiences are not Abuſed by him unto Licentiouſneſs, but are carefully Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up, for the rendring of himſelf and others more Serviceable to the Lord, in Preſent and Succeſſive Generations. If God hath not Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Prayer, <hi>pſa.</hi> 102. 17, (when <hi>Overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as the Title hath it,) this ſhall be written by him for the Generations that are to come, <hi>v.</hi> 18. If he perceive that ſome Boſom-ſin hath been the Death of any, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were of <hi>Saul,</hi> by ſhooting at a Diſtance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 3: this alſo ſhall be written in the Book of <hi>Jaſher</hi> (or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,)</hi> that Others may learn to uſe the Bow, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 17, 18, and <hi>Timely</hi> reſiſt ſuch
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102526:154"/> Mortal Adverſaries. Or if himſelf hath Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Miſery of Hiding Sin, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32. 3, 4, and the Benefit of an Ingenuous Confeſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 5; this alſo ſhall be Written, that ſo every Godly man may be Inſtructed to Pray unto the Lord in a time of Finding, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And thus he laboureth to make others Better than Himſelf, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his Experiences unto them; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (with his dear-bought Spoils) ſought to Enrich that Temple, which yet Himſelf came ſhort of.</p>
            <p>And as the Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> in the latter dayes, ſhall Threſh the forenamed Nations, <hi>(viz.</hi> their <hi>Edomitiſh</hi> falſe Brethren, their <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiſh</hi> perſecuting Kindred, their Indulged Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> their <hi>Amalekitiſh</hi> Worldly friends, and their <hi>Syrian</hi> (or <hi>Aſſyrian)</hi> Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Enemies,) they ſhall then Conſecrate their Gain and Subſtance to the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, and ſhall not raiſe a Private Intereſt upon the others Ruines, as did the Little Horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24, unto the Lords Diſhonour and his Peoples Prejudice, <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are not Men after God's own heart, who either do Abuſe what they have Gained by ſuch like Conflicts, or do convert it unto ſome Lower or ſelfiſh uſe, and not unto the ſpiritual or Publick good and benefit of Preſent and After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>David</hi> did Magnifie <hi>God's Law</hi> or <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word;</hi> accounting it the ordinary means of Inſtruction, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 105, Reformation, <hi>v.</hi> 9, and Converſion, <hi>pſa.</hi> 19. 7: wherewith he did Conſult, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 24, and laboured to direct

            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> doth Advance the Scriptures; Diſputing from them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 2; Proving his Doctrine by them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Study of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15, as being given by Inſpiration, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, both as a Laſting Rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. 14, and Perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are not men after God's own heart, who ſeek to Diſgrace the Scriptures; calling them (according to their own Improvement of them) a <hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> a <hi>Dead Letter,</hi> of uſe for <hi>young Beginners</hi> onely, but not for All, at leaſt-wiſe not a <hi>Perfect</hi> or <hi>Onely Rule;</hi> by which they ſadly evidence that there is no Light in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20, whileſt they Pretend to be Diſcharged therefrom, becauſe of the Day-ſtar Riſen in their hearts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19; which place (if rightly underſtood) doth no way Antiquate the Scriptures unto Any, as the Sole Rule of Life, untill Chriſt's Perſonal Appearance, who Then is called the <hi>Bright</hi> and <hi>Morning-ſtar,</hi> Rev. 22. 16; till when, himſelf ſadly Denounceth againſt thoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20, who either Adde

            <p>Thoſe are not men after God's own heart, who do deſpiſe Chriſt's Inſtitutions; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully calling them <hi>Beggarly Elements, Worldly</hi> or <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> and things which onely are of uſe for Children under Age; as if they might take liberty to ſpeak of Chriſt's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Goſpel, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ceremonies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 3. 9. But a Gracious heart knoweth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtration might not be Taken away, untill Chriſt came in Perſon or in the Fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9: and then it is not likely, that Chriſt's own Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or Inſtitutions ſhall be Lawfully Taken away, by any other but Himſelf, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be Held faſt untill He Come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 25. He knoweth, that the Goſpel-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which ſignifieth Inſtituted Worſhip) was not Deſtroyed (in Myſtical <hi>Babylon)</hi> but onely ſhut up, (as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip was in Literal <hi>Babylon)</hi> which is ſeen Opened afterwards, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19, to ſignifie its being ſtill in force; even under the Seventh Trumpet, <hi>v.</hi> 15.

            <p>Nay he is alſo very Zealous for Purity in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for Goſpel-Ordinances without Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Intermixtures; and for the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs together with its Form: all which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly advanced by him, without Carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and with utmoſt Joy, notwithſtanding his Outward Coſt or Perſonal Loſſes thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. And though he may not out-live a Lower or Tabernacle-ſtate, yet doth he carefully Prepare for the ſetting forth of that Glory, which upon Earth he may not be a Sharer in. And as this hath Alway been the Diſpoſition of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, ſo it will much more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (in all thoſe fore-mentioned reſpects) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Temporal rearing up of <hi>David</hi>'s Tabernacle, or under the Seventh Trumpet's Sounding.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>David</hi> was not Diſcouraged from his <hi>Duty</hi> by what he met with, but rather was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereby in its Purſuance.

               <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 126; he therefore Loved it above Gold, <hi>v.</hi> 127, and did Eſteem it to be Right, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every falſe way, <hi>ver.</hi> 128. Though he was <hi>ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> was not Diſcouraged by what he met with in his Advancing Chriſt's Ark or Goſpel-truths; but was the more Bold and Zealous, becauſe others did Blaſpheme, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 45, 46; and went on ſtill, though ſome did <hi>ſcoff</hi> at him, as if he were Beſide himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 24; though he was Deſpiſed, Defamed, Reviled, Perſecuted, Buffetted, made as the Filth of the World, and a Spectacle to all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; though he was Troubled, Perplexed, and Caſt down, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9; yea though his Life was in continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24, and though he had been oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Deaths, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wicked flee when no man purſueth, but the Righteous are bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28. 1; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4, although their way be never ſo Solitary, Deep, and Dangerous. Diſcouragements are

            <p n="11">11. <hi>David</hi> did highly Prize <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Love;</hi> which he accounted Excellent, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 36. 7; able to make his Broken bones Rejoyce, <hi>pſa.</hi> 51. 8; the Light of whoſe Countenance is Saving, <hi>pſa.</hi> 80. 19; and was ſet by him in oppoſition to all Earthly good, <hi>pſal.</hi> 4. 6; whoſe Comforts did Delight his Soul, in the Multitude of his thoughts within him, <hi>pſal.</hi> 94. 19; in whoſe Favour is Life, <hi>pſa.</hi> 30. 5; and whoſe Loving-kindneſs is better than Life, <hi>pſa.</hi> 63. 3; who therefore was Troubled, when God did Hide his face, <hi>pſal.</hi> 30. 7; and onely deſired, that God would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him in his Wrath, nor chaſten him in his hot Diſpleaſure, <hi>pſa.</hi> 38. 1.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> valued God's Love at a very high rate, as being that which Paſſeth Knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19; which therefore he deſired, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14; and by which he was Conſtrained to Live unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>A Slave may be Exanimated with his Maſter's Anger, but he that is born of God doth chiefly Live by his Heavenly Father's Love; which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more Gladneſs into his heart, than when the Worldling's Corn and Wine encreaſeth, <hi>pſ.</hi> 4. 7.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102526:160"/> Light of God's Countenance, is that, without which he cannot ſee the Creature's Beauty, nor be affected with it. He may be content to walk in Darkneſs, becauſe it is his Father's pleaſure; but one of God's Smiles is more to him than all the World, which therefore his Love-ſick Soul is panting after, and will not hazard its loſs for all the Pleaſures that ſin affordeth.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>David</hi> was well contented with his <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lot,</hi> accounting it a goodly Heritage, <hi>pſal.</hi> 16. 6; becauſe the Lord was the portion of his Inheritance, <hi>v.</hi> 5; beſides whom he had none in Heaven, nor deſired any upon Earth, <hi>pſa.</hi> 73. 25; in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of Joy, <hi>pſa.</hi> 16. 11; and whoſe Everlaſting Covenant was all his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Deſire, although his Houſe was not made to Grow, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> had learned, in whatſoever ſtate he was, therewith to be Content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, even when he was abaſed, hungry, and ſuffered need, <hi>v.</hi> 12, yet then he had All, and was Full and did Abound, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Contentment is joyned with Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6; and whileſt others mind Earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19, a Gracious heart doth converſe in Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 20, where his chief Treaſure is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21.

            <p n="13">13. <hi>David</hi> was for the converting of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies into Duty; which he knew to be God's Deſign, who therefore had girded him with gladneſs, to the End that his glory might ſing Praiſe unto him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 30. 11, 12.

And though he had more underſtanding than all his Teachers, <hi>pſa.</hi> 119. 99; yet did he confeſs, that ſome Knowledge was too Wonderfull for him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139. 6; nor was he ſo Haughty, as to intermeddle with things too High, <hi>pſa.</hi> 131. 1. Nay he was ſo far from Boaſting before the Lord, becauſe of what he did; as that he did account his moſt Coſtly Service to be a ſpecial Priviledge, whereof he was not Worthy, and for which he returned Thanks, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> judged himſelf unmeet to be called an Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9; although he was not a whit behind the very chiefeſt of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. And though he was a very ſpiritual man, yet was he ſenſible of his being alſo Carnal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. And though he knew more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, yet doth he confeſs that his knowledge was but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9; and that ſome things were paſt his finding out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33; who therefore doth check Intruders into thoſe things which they have not ſeen, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18; and through the Grace of God given to him, he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth every man not to think of himſelf more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he ought, but ſoberly, according to that meaſure of Faith which God hath dealt unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. Nay he did count it an act of Gods Dignifying Grace, that he ſhould be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt unto the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 15, 16; the imparting of whoſe Gift unto them, was that which did ſatifie his own earneſt longing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>The Natural mans Priviledges, do lift up his heart before the Lord: ſo alſo doe his Parts and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102526:162"/> ſuppoſed Graces. But a man after Gods own heart, is not thereby made to forget his remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imperfections, or to think that he is any other than unprofitable, when he hath done all that is commanded, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10; but rather, that his being Employed by the Lord, is to be reckoned by him among the greateſt of his engagements.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>David</hi> did utterly renounce his beſt inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs, with reference unto his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby Juſtified in the ſight of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was Gods <hi>Servant,</hi> ye did he pray, that God would not enter into Judgement with his <hi>Servant,</hi> for in his ſight ſhall no man living be Juſtified, <hi>pſ.</hi> 143. 2; which clearly proveth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of a ſaints beſt Righteouſneſs (in point of Habits as well as Acts) to Juſtifie him in the ſight of God: ſince this is Expreſly meant, of not being Juſtified in Gods ſight, which neceſſarily inferreth, to be <hi>Condemned</hi> by him (directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Benefit of Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16.) and which therefore cannot be underſtood with reference unto the Saints Chaſtiſements onely: nor can <hi>David</hi> here be thought to pray, that God would not Judge him (as the Papiſts plead) in a way of comparing his Righteouſneſs with Gods, or in a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his inherent Grace; (ſince he had no cauſe to fear his being thus ſeverely dealt with by ſtrict Divine Juſtice,) but he doth Onely beg, that he might not be Judged according to his own Beſt obedience, for then he never ſhould be Juſtified in the ſight of God. And as he doth (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) renounce his own righteouſneſs, ſo doth
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102526:163"/> he elſewhere pronounce him bleſſed whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is <hi>Forgiven,</hi> whoſe ſin is <hi>Covered, Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. which <hi>Cover</hi> cannot be meant of inheren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> righteouſneſs, Partly becauſe this <hi>Covering</hi> here, is manifeſtly of the ſame import with being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; now Sanctification and Pardon, are two Diverſe benefits Diſtinctly mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 9. 10; and therefore that <hi>Covering</hi> of ſins, which ſignifieth their being <hi>Forgiven</hi> cannot be meant of Inherent Righteouſneſs: and Partly becauſe the Saints Beſt obedience is comprehended in that word <hi>[Works]</hi> which <hi>Works,</hi> are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be that <hi>[For Which]</hi> a man is Juſtified in Gods ſight, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth prove from theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth herein concur with <hi>David</hi> both as to the Negative and Poſitive formal cauſe of being Juſtified, as hath been abundantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Negative, <hi>Paul</hi> plainly telleth us, that we are ſaved by <hi>Grace</hi> and not of <hi>Works, Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9: which Denial of Works, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto Works before Faith (as the Papiſts plead,) Partly becauſe the Spirit of God doth here make no ſuch exception; nor had he now to deal with vainglorious Jews, but ſinful Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who had no works before Faith whereof to Boaſt, as the Jews had: Partly becauſe, Faith is firſt mentioned, as being that Through which we are ſaved, and then <hi>Works</hi> are denyed Afterwards; to ſignifie, that he alſo inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thoſe works of Grace which follow Faith: and Partly, becauſe the ſame kind of Works muſt needs be meant in the Denial, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102526:163"/> in the Reaſons for which they are denyed; <hi>(viz.</hi> 1, Leſt any man ſhould Boaſt; 2. Becauſe we are his workmanſhip <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works;</hi> 3. <hi>which God hath before ordained that we ſhould Walk in them:)</hi> but every of thoſe Reaſons relate to works after Faith; ſince Theſe onely are ſuch as we are created unto in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; which God onely hath ordained, as a <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Walk</hi> in, but not as any <hi>Cauſes</hi> of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that ſo he might prevent our Boaſting, which otherwiſe could not be, ſince a Believer might elſe Boaſt, that Salvation is Due to him <hi>Working,</hi> and conſequently though the Giving of ſtrength to work with, would be an act of Grace, yet the accounting of <hi>Wages</hi> unto that work, would be of <hi>Debt</hi> and not of <hi>Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo he telleth us that Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs, to him that <hi>Worketh not, Rom.</hi> 4. 5; which cannot be limited to works before faith, becauſe he there ſpeaketh of <hi>Abraham, v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, who had been Regenerated long before that time, and yet is here ſaid to be Juſtified, not by <hi>Works,</hi> which therefore muſt needs include works of <hi>Grace</hi> as well as any other, or ſuch as his Circumciſion was, which was a good work, relating to God, and proceeding from faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>And to the ſame purpoſe he elſewhere doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Juſtification, whatever <hi>Working</hi> is beſides <hi>Believing, Gal.</hi> 2. 16, and, 3. 11; which therefore cannot be limited, either unto Ceremonial <hi>Works</hi> alone, or unto other <hi>Works before</hi> faith or <hi>Without</hi> it: and which indeed is evident other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, it is
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102526:164"/> not the Ceremonial Law which ſaith, <hi>Doe</hi> this and thou ſhalt live; which yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, in this Diſcourſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12: nor can he be thought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Deny thoſe <hi>Works</hi> which are before faith or without it; ſince theſe Renewed <hi>Galathians</hi> could not be ſo fooliſh as to think themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juſtified by their <hi>Natural</hi> than by their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Works;</hi> and ſince <hi>Paul</hi> doth Diſſwade them from ſeeking to be Juſtified by <hi>Works,</hi> by the ſad conſequent thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> their being made perfect by the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3, and their being then Fallen from Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth ſufficiently, that they never intended to Renounce the help of Grace or their ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</p>
            <p>Nor doth he Contradict this Denyal of All Works in point of Juſtification, in any other place; however ſome would ſain improve an Appearance of that nature. He doth indeed tell the hypocritical <hi>Jew,</hi> that, Not the <hi>Hearers</hi> of the Law are juſt before God, but the <hi>Doers</hi> thereof ſhall be Juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13: not to feed ſuch with a vain hope of being Juſtified by Works; but meerly to convince thoſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, who boaſted of their bare <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Law, which could not Juſtifie without the <hi>Doing</hi> of it, according to the <hi>Jews</hi> own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the tenour of their Legal Covenant. He alſo telleth us, that we are not Juſtified or Saved by <hi>works</hi> of Righteouſneſs which we <hi>have done,</hi> Tit. 3. 5; not meerly to exclude thoſe works which had been <hi>formerly</hi> done without the help of Grace; but onely to ſhew, that no man can plead his being ſaved, by any works
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102526:164"/> that he <hi>Hath</hi> done, but that we are Juſtified by Gods meer Grace or Favour, <hi>v.</hi> 7, and not by our being Renewed; for then it ſhould have run thus, That being juſtified <hi>Thereby,</hi> viz. our Regeneration, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, which doth Immediately goe before. So alſo he telleth us, that we are Juſtified by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1: but not as it is a <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> Cauſe to be Juſtified by, but meerly as an Inſtrument to lay hold upon that Righteouſneſs which God hath provided by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. He alſo tearmeth thoſe works <hi>Fleſh,</hi> by which ſome thought to be Juſtified in the ſight of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3: not onely to Deny thoſe works which were done <hi>without</hi> the help of Gods Spirit; but meerly to Diſgrace all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Works whatever, in point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince the moſt Spiritual works themſelves do deſerve to be called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Affirmative, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that Faith alone (as it layeth hold upon a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Imputed) doth Juſtifie before the Lord, in oppoſition to all thoſe works which he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Denyed. He plainly ſheweth, that Chriſt doth Anſwer unto <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Publick perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repreſenting all his Seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14; and that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which Juſtifieth unto Life, doth Anſwer to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offence which brought forth Condemnation, <hi>v.</hi> 18; and that Chriſt's <hi>Obedience</hi> doth make his ſeed <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience did make his Seed Sinners, <hi>v.</hi> 19: now we were all made <hi>Sinners,</hi> by that One act of <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the forbidden Fruit, ſevered from that Inherent Sin received
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102526:165"/> from him, as the Juſt Puniſhment of his firſt tranſgreſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 12; and therefore (by the Rule of Oppoſition, hinted in that word, <hi>So,)</hi> all Chriſt's Seed are <hi>made</hi> (or <hi>conſtituted,</hi> as the Greek word ſignifieth,) Righteous, by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>One,</hi> viz. Chriſt, ſevered from that Inherent Righteouſneſs, which is received from him, as the deſerved Fruit of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, is (not <hi>In,</hi> but) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon</hi> all them that do Believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22; and that Chriſt is a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, <hi>v.</hi> 25, which can be no way applyed to Inherent Righteouſneſs: and that Chriſt was made Sin for Us, <hi>(viz.</hi> by <hi>Our Sin) that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as the Oppoſition doth naturally evince. And therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> deſire, that he might be found <hi>In him,</hi> (which plainly ſheweth that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Juſtification is <hi>Without us,)</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, without Excepting thoſe works of Grace, which he doth Diſtinctly mention afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 10, as he had done before, <hi>v.</hi> 8; ſince <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs, (viz.</hi> in point of being Juſtified by Works) <hi>to every one that doth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are not men after Gods own heart, who think to be Juſtified in the ſight of God, by any other than a bare <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs.</hi> A man of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit, is for the Perfecting of Holineſs unto the Juſtification of his Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102526:165"/> 2. 18; but yet with reference unto the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Juſtification of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> he humbly beggeth, that God would not Enter into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him.</p>
            <p>And thus I have now wholly finiſhed this Latter Branch of <hi>David</hi>'s Deſcription in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> as he was <hi>in Himſelf conſidered,</hi> or as he did evidence himſelf to be a man after God's own heart, both by his more <hi>Inward Frame,</hi> and by that <hi>Outward</hi> Demonſtration which he gave of his being ſuch an one, ſo far as it may be gathered, from his Profeſſed <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and conſtant <hi>Practices</hi> or Carriage, both towards the <hi>Creature</hi> and towards <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now onely remaineth, that I ſhould Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Latter Branch, as I have done the Former, <hi>viz.</hi> in a way of <hi>Trial, Inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>What are our conſtant <hi>Practices?</hi> Do they agree with <hi>David</hi>'s? Then are we Right, ſo far as Fruits do evidence the Nature of a Tree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
            <p>What alſo are our <hi>Principles?</hi> Since ſome Opinions are reckoned up among thoſe Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102526:166"/> Works, which are moſt Manifeſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>But more Eſpecially, What are our <hi>Inward Frames?</hi> which are the Life and Soul of both the former; and which none knoweth, but the Spirit of Man, which is <hi>In</hi> him, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>I forbear to reckon up the ſeveral Particulars, relating to each of theſe General heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are very many, and ſhall therefore referre the Reader to what hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>And though I will not be over-rigorous, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon others, as to every Circumſtance or Degree of what <hi>David</hi> attained unto; yet if we do not Agree with him as to the Main thereof, we cannot groundedly expect to ſhare with him, in that Teſtimony which God gave of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, We may hence learn (for our <hi>Inſtruction)</hi> what may be the <hi>ſad</hi> Portion of one who is a man after Gods own heart, by our obſerving what did befall <hi>David</hi> after his having received this Teſtimony from the Lord.</p>
            <p>And ſo, in the General, we read concerning <hi>David,</hi> that his Bones were vexed, his Soul alſo was ſore vexed, <hi>pſa.</hi> 6. 2, 3, being wearied with his groaning, and making his Bed to ſwim all Night, and watering his Couch with Tears, ſo that his Eye was conſumed becauſe of Grief, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. The ſorrows of Death and Hell did compaſs him about, <hi>pſa.</hi> 18. 4, 5; yea, he was poured out like Water, and all his Bones were
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102526:166"/> out of Joynt, his heart was melted like Waxe within him, his Strength was dried like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, his Tongue clave to his Jaws, and he was brought into the duſt of Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 14, 15. And in the midſt of all this outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, he remembred God and was troubled, he Complained and his Spirit was overwhelmed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 3</p>
            <p>All which may be the portion of the Holieſt man that is; and therefore none may condemn himſelf or others, meerly from the want of <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> Comfort, or from the preſence of overwhelming Sorrows, which <hi>Paul</hi> found, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. &amp; 11. 23, to 27.</p>
            <p>But we have alſo a more Particular account of <hi>David</hi>'s hard Meaſures, as they were brought upon him, either, By <hi>Man,</hi> or by the <hi>Lord,</hi> or by <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Firſt, <hi>David</hi> was very hardly dealt with by <hi>Man,</hi> and by all ſorts of Men, as will more fully appear, in all theſe following reſpects, together with their Aggravations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> had Many Enemies, who were moe than the hairs of his head, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69. 4; which made him to crie out, <hi>Lord! how are they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed that trouble me; Many are they that riſe up againſt me,</hi> Pſal. 3. 1. All the Multitude cried out againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ought not to live any longer, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 24; ſo that a Godly man is ſure to Die, if the Major Vote be empowered to paſs that Sentence; in which reſpect, a ſad Woe is denounced againſt them whom All men ſpeak well of, for ſo did their Fathers to the falſe Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102526:167"/> 2. And when <hi>David</hi> was thus ſurrounded by the Generality, the reſt did Deſpiſe him, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Lip, and ſhaking the head againſt him, <hi>pſa.</hi> 22. 6, 7. So alſo, <hi>Paul</hi>'s bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was counted weak, and his ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10; yea he was made a Spectacle to the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9, and as its filth or Off ſcouring. <hi>v.</hi> 13; as all thoſe muſt expect to be, of whom the world is not worthy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And ſo ſoon as <hi>David</hi> was anointed King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came up to ſeek him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 17, who had been formerly very courteous to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 6. And thus, ſo ſoon as the Saints Temporal Anointing becometh General and Viſible, they then may expect to be ſought after, by their moſt Groſſely Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian adverſaries, who have been ſometimes Favourable to them, in the time of their being Perſecuted by a more Refined Intereſt, with whom themſelves alſo were at variance. And this hath alway been the Saints Portion, to be purſued by thoſe of a Profaner ſpirit, ſo ſoon as their ſpiritual Anoynting hath been heard of; as <hi>Paul</hi> was by thoſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> immediately upon his firſt Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 29: which alſo holdeth true with reference unto their Groſſer inward Luſts, which then are more outrageous than ever they were before; and therefore let no young Convert be diſcouraged, ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he findeth ſome unuſual ſtirrings of Inward Luſts, ſo that he be not Overcome thereby, no more than <hi>David</hi> was by thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was once in danger of being ſlain by a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102526:167"/> 
               <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Giant, when himſelf was faint, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 15, 16, as a good man may be by ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, when his Strength faileth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> became the Object of <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Envy</hi> and mortal Hatred, meerly becauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Commendations and greater worth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 8, 9. 29, ſo that there was but a ſtep between him and Death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 3. And thus when the Multitude flocked after <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with Envy, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 45; and took unto them certain lewd ſellows of the baſer ſort, and ſet the City in an Uproar, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 5; and ſome of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> banded together, and bound themſelves under a Curſe, that they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eat nor Drink till they had killed him, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 12. A man after Gods own heart, muſt look to be the Object of carnal Profeſſors Envy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when his deſerved Praiſe doth any whit Eclipſe the Luſtre of their Eſteem among the People. <hi>Active</hi> Envy is one ſad ſign of a Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and <hi>Paſſive</hi> Envy is both the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Portion of a Gracious Soul.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

And in the mean while, it hath been the Saints common Portion, to tarry a long while for that ſpiritual Crown, which he was Elected unto, before the Foundation of the VVorld, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4, and which he was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto at his firſt Converſion: during which ſad Interval there is but little ſeeming difference between himſelf and others, ſave onely that he ſtandeth upon his own Defence, as <hi>David</hi> did againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> but apt to flee before his over-potent Adverſary, and ſometimes to conclude, that he ſhall one day Periſh by the hand of his Rebellion and Unbelief. Thoſe have no cauſe to call in queſtion a work of Grace begun, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they do not for a long while get the Throne; ſo that they do but keep themſelves
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:102526:173"/> from being taken Captive by their Spiritual Adverſaries; or ſo long as it is no worſe with them than it was with <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. When <hi>David</hi> had obtained a very Full and Peaceable poſſeſſion of his VVhole Kingdom over all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord did yet exerciſe him with further moleſtations, not onely from the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> (by whom his Life was once endangered, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 15, 16;) but alſo by a general Defection of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> from him, as hath been formerly declared. Which is a fair <hi>warning</hi> to the Saints, whenever their Temporal Rule ſhall become more univerſal. And in the mean while, let every Gracious Soul expect, that when his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Dominion over <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> is come up to ſome good Degree of <hi>ſettlement,</hi> he may be ſtill exerciſed with Inward ſad Defections, and with ſome Groſſer onſets from VVithout. And as we would Prevent ſuch Inward Rebellions, let us take heed of Groſs breach of Duty, which was the Pocuring Cauſe of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Riſing up againſt his Father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10, 11. And as we would not be Endangered by our encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Temptations, ſo let us take heed of engaging therewith unneceſſarily, (as <hi>David</hi> then did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 17.) and of going out againſt them without Enquiring of God, (which <hi>David</hi> did not formerly omit, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 19. 23.) eſpecially when we are Faint (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> then was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 15.) and when we have to do with ſome Giant, girded with a New

            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> met with no ſmall Diſcouragement from the Lord, in his removal of the Ark into his own Houſe and City; which was a good and Pious act, wherein his Predeceſſor failed, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 3: but yet then did God Trie good <hi>David,</hi> by ſtriking <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> preſently with Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did but hold the ſhaking Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6, 7: which though it was a Righteous Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (as <hi>David</hi> afterwards confeſſed, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 13.) yet was it ſorely Trying, that God ſhould thus ſnib his ſervants Zeal, which put him to a preſent plunge, that he durſt proceed no further, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Let not a good man wonder, in caſe he meeteth with ſome Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential rub, in the purſuance of his holy Zeal, for the Advancing of what was typified by God's Ark. Good attempts are apt to be accompanyed with bad ſucceſs; eſpecially when matters of this nature are not mannaged with utmoſt care: Religious things are very curiouſly to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled with; and if a due Manner be not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto, together with the Matter, it is not a Godly Zeal that will ſecure a <hi>David</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whipped, at leaſt-wiſe upon another's back. Let us remember <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> when we are apt to lay the Warrant of our Action upon the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Intention: and let us remember <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s caſe, when we are tempted to think, that ſuch an act is Evil, meerly becauſe it meeteth with ſome Providential check; which may put
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102526:175"/> us upon Enquiring into the procuring Cauſe thereof, but ſhould not abſolutely diſcourage us therefrom; nor will it long have any ſuch undue impreſſion upon a gracious heart, no more than this Temptation had upon <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> could not Avert by his Earneſt Prayer, either the untimely Death of his poor Child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 16, 18. 22, or the ſad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Subjects, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. 15.

It is poſſible, that ſome Spiritual good thing deſired (at leaſt-wiſe Priviledges) may not be thought Good for us at Preſent; though uſually ſuch Petitions (at leaſtwiſe if for Grace) are moſtly ineffectual, through want of Uprightneſs and Fervour. But in relation to Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings (which <hi>David</hi> could not obtain) let not the Beſt man wonder, in caſe he be not Heard: and as we would not be Denyed, ſo let us take heed of Sin, which may Obſtruct our Prayer as <hi>David</hi>'s did) although our Holineſs cannot Deſerve its Audience.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Lord charged <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears; and brought a Famine in <hi>David</hi>'s time

In the mean while, we may obſerve from hence, that a Godly Succeſſour may fare the worſe becauſe of his Predeceſſours failings; as an Innocent Child may outwardly be afflicted becauſe of his Parent's Sin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5; and as the Good Diſciples were all of them charged with ſpeaking that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 8, which was indeed onely uttered by <hi>Judas,</hi> Joh. 12. 4, 5. However, a Gracious Soul hath no cauſe to wonder, in caſe he be dealt with after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for ſome former miſcarriages in the time of his Unregeneracy; as good old <hi>Job</hi> was made to poſſeſs the Iniquities of his Vain and Youthful State, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26, which <hi>David</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayeth that God would not remember, <hi>pſa.</hi> 25. 7, and which it is therefore our Wiſdom as well as Duty to be Humbled for, firſt in relation to our ſelves, and then to others, ſince a little Leaven may infect the Whole, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. 6, And herein good <hi>David</hi> was defective, becauſe he did not endeavour timely to purge away that Guilt which he could not but know that <hi>Saul</hi> had brought upon the Nation, and for which himſelf was therefore thus chaſtiſed with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; which kind of Puniſhment (at leaſt-wiſe

The Temple was the Place of Gods Reſt, (in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the Moving Tabernacle) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Temple was a Type of happy Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>David</hi> might not attain unto on Earth, becauſe he had ſhed Blood, and yet that very Blood-ſhed was onely in the purſuance of his blameleſs Duty. <hi>David</hi>'s Diſpenſation (Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s) doth fitly anſwer unto the Kingdom of the Stone, diſtinct from that of the Mountain; the former of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to Chriſt's Rule in and among his Saints, as the Latter doth unto his Rule in Perſon: which Diſpenſations God will preſerve Diſtinct, and not ſuffer them to be Confounded each with other; ſo that the Ruling Saints muſt not expect to have that Perfect Settlement (in matters Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Spiritual) which is reſerved till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards And in the mean while, let no Gracious man wonder, if he doth yet come ſhort of that Reſurrection of the Dead (in point of Grace and Comfort) which he is Now labouring to Attain unto or Apprehend, and which he doth therefore <hi>follow</hi> after and <hi>reach</hi> forth unto and <hi>preſs</hi> toward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. Thoſe do pretend unto more than either <hi>David</hi> had or <hi>Paul</hi> expected, who dream of any Abſolute
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102526:176"/> Perfection, on this ſide a Literal Reſurrection from the Dead: and they who thus boaſt of a Licenſe to build that Temple in this Life, do give others juſt ground to think, that they have never been God's Warriours as <hi>David</hi> was, who therefore was thus Typically prohibited; but yet he Now is eminently intereſted in that happy Perfection which was typified by that Temple, and which every of God's faithful War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours ſhall one day ſhare with him in. And leſt ſome ſhould Abuſe this Cordial, unto the diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding of their Imperfections, becauſe no man on Earth is abſolutely Perfect; let ſuch remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they are not men after God's own heart (as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were) who do not ſtrenuouſly Preſs after what yet they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto whileſt Warriours, ſince Abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection implyeth Peace or Quietneſs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (Partly) the Warring Witneſſes muſt firſt Die before they Reign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. 15, as Chriſt himſelf did, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26, and as the beſt of his Servants muſt expect to doe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, the Vail of whoſe Fleſh muſt be rent in twain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can look into that <hi>Holy of Holyes,</hi> which was a Type of more abſolute Perfection.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102526:177"/> that Spirit which he was acted by in ſhedding blood, although the Matter of that work was Blameleſs Duty.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe might not be made to <hi>Grow,</hi> as himſelf doth intimate, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5; Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foreſeeing, that Ten Tribes would ſoon fall off from thence, as the deſerved Conſequent of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s backſliding into Senſuality and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, by the ſolicitation of his <hi>many</hi> and <hi>ſtrange</hi> Wives, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 4. 11.

And let ſuch alſo know, that in relation to all theſe forementioned Trials, (as alſo thoſe which follow) there is a time come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when all theſe Tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 4.</p>
            <p>This is the Summe of thoſe Afflictions which <hi>David</hi> met with more Immediately from <hi>God</hi> himſelf: which is the Second Branch of this Uſe for our Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>III. Thirdly, <hi>David</hi>'s hardeſt meaſures of all, were ſuch as he met with from <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or from his own <hi>Corruption:</hi> whoſe Failings in that reſpect, are alſo regiſtred in the Scriptures, not for Encouragement to do the like, but for our Warning. And if any ſhall take occaſion hence to Cheriſh the like Diſtempers in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, let ſuch know, that this act alone doth ſufficiently diſcover what they are; ſince none of God's People have ever dared thus to doe, with reference unto a Known Temptation. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is called <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2, or the <hi>God of Flies;</hi> and <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> word is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24, or the <hi>God of Dung,</hi> becauſe of what thoſe Flies did Feed upon: and Satan indeed doth ſeem to be Their God, who (like thoſe filthy Flies) do feed upon ſuch Myſtical Excreſcencies. And on the other ſide, let none
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102526:179"/> evidence that they are ſorry Virgins (and not Spouſes) by their being Nice and Coy in a way of Humour; or by their being apt to take Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the ſober Mentioning of <hi>David</hi>'s Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which cannot be Hid, and which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left upon Record, that ſo all might take notice of them for their good: eſpecially ſince <hi>Paul</hi> was guided by the Holy Ghoſt, to reckon up <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s failings in the Wilderneſs, becauſe thoſe things were our Examples, and were written for our Admonition, to the intent that we ſhould not Luſt after Evil things, as they alſo Luſted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi>'s recorded Failings were either more <hi>Groſs</hi> or more <hi>Refined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He very Groſſely fell in that matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> wherein the ſpeech of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might be applyed to him, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 1, becauſe he therein was ſo Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; which is enough to terrifie every one from treading in the ſame ſteps; eſpecially ſince <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, that no ſuch Straglers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, neither take they hold of the paths of Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 19, however this Single <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> might be Miraculouſly recovered. And let it alſo be conſidered, how dearly <hi>David</hi> was made to pay for this Sin of his, both in a way of Inward Horrour, Perpetual Ignominy, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sufferings of the ſame kind, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10, 11, although his own Life was <hi>ſpared,</hi> by an act of <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> v. 13; and yet it is alſo evident, that he did not then walk up unto the top of his Houſe, with any Set Purpoſe to Fall thus from thence, but was meerly Overtaken there with this Temptation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2, that others
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102526:180"/> might take heed of ſuch like Occaſions, and leſt they fall from one great ſin into another, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did; who yet when Raiſed up, did never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into the ſame again.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome other of his more Refined Failings mentioned, which the Beſt of men are Subject unto and which are as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth, that himſelf (among the reſt) did not in <hi>Saul</hi>'s dayes <hi>Enquire</hi> at the Ark of God, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 3, as was his bounden Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 25. 22. Now that Ark was placed at the Weſt end of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Holyes</hi> (which was a Type of Heaven, the place of Gods preſence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) or at the fartheſt diſtance from the Eaſt or Worldly <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> it being the cuſtom of Idolaters to worſhip towards the Eaſt or Sun-riſing. And ſo, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Profeſſors (at leaſt-wiſe in the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> who typified the <hi>Man of Sin,)</hi> have ſadly neglected to Enquire of God in the way of his Appointment; and have conſulted (as <hi>Saul</hi> was wont to doe) with their own Will, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Policy, and natural Reaſon, and meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, in the things of God; which hath continued both them and their Leaders, in many ſad Conſequents of that prepoſterous courſe. But ſo ſoon as <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom was competently ſettled, he then bethought himſelf of rectifying this abuſe more Generally, though he was formerly furniſhed with the Ephod, for his own Private Direction, which was accordingly impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ved. And as to his forementioned Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, himſelf was then Conſtrained thereunto, through <hi>Saul</hi>'s prophaneneſs; which cannot be
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102526:180"/> ſo fairly pleaded by us in Goſpel times, ſince the Ark of God's Preſence is now more eaſie to be come by, and not Confined to one certain Place as heretofore it was. However, <hi>David</hi> was timely ſenſible of that miſcarriage, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it; and nothing ſhort of that, will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſuch like Tranſgreſſors in theſe latter dayes, are men of a truely Gracious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> was ſomewhat Haſty, as himſelf confeſſeth; who ſaid in his Haſte, that he was Cut off, <hi>pſal.</hi> 31. 22, and that All men were Liars, <hi>pſal.</hi> 116. 11, chiefly referring unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> becauſe that Kingdom was ſo long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, which <hi>Samuel</hi> had Anointed him unto. Hope deferred is apt to make the heart ſick, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13. 12; and as all ſick Perſons are ſubject to be Pettiſh, ſo ſome talk Idly then, which is more ordinary in this kind of Sickneſs. When Chriſt was Dead, ſome of his Diſciples began to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether this was He, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21, yea though they did then confeſs a Confirmation of it, by a ſufficient Report that he was Raiſed again, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24, who therefore were ſharply rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for their Folly and Unbelief, <hi>v.</hi> 25, as thoſe muſt expect to be, who are alike guilty. But thus to Cut off our ſelves (in caſe we be not Speedily relieved) is that which a Gracious heart is ſubject unto, both in relation to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Spiritual Temptations. We are very prone to Limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto our Time and Way of fulfilling what he hath promiſed; which if it doth not prove according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we then give all for Loſt, and though we
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:102526:181"/> may not dare to Queſtion the Word of God, yet may we boldl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> call that a falſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which may be the Truth. But <hi>David</hi> did onely ſpeak thus in Haſte, and did Correct himſelf in Time, becauſe he was ſtill endued with that Spirit of Faith, whoſe preſent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe was for a while Suſpended, <hi>pſal.</hi> 116. 10: which is enough to ſtartle thoſe, who do in Cool blood Maintain what is the iſſue of their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and who do Perſiſt therein notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſufficient means offered for their Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> was ſometimes overpowered to make himſelf Worſe than indeed he was; as when he Feigned himſelf Mad, before <hi>Achiſh</hi> the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 13; and when he Pretended to the ſame <hi>Achiſh,</hi> that he had been fighting againſt the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 10; and when he bore <hi>Achiſh</hi> in hand, that he intended to be for him againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. 8. And thus in the dayes of <hi>Saul</hi> or the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> many Profeſſors have been tempted to Feign themſelves Mad, and to make as if they had not the Exerciſe of their Reaſon and Underſtanding, to know ſuch Truths and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which any ordinary man might ſee with half an Eye; and which themſelves knew well enough, but that they were Afraid to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by the diſcovery of their Abilities: nay many have made an Outward ſhew of being <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> ſuch Things or Perſons, which in their Hearts they have been Contrarily affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This is a great miſcarriage, which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much unto the blemiſhing of our Profeſſion;
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102526:181"/> and which the ſubtle <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Lords will not be alway deluded with, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. 4, however Simple <hi>Achiſh</hi> might be ſatisfied, <hi>ver.</hi> 9; and which diſcovered Incredulity of theirs hath been in much mercy to theſe poor ſelf-enſnaring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers. But let us know, that <hi>David</hi> yet was but a Young Profeſſor, (which many cannot plead) and that his failing was not in point of Action, but onely of Expreſſion and Appearance; which therefore cannot be compared with their Diſſimulation, who do proceed further. And as we would be preſerved from ſuch a Snare, ſo let us take heed of what betrayed <hi>David</hi> herein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which was his forementioned Haſtineſs or Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi>'s Unbelief drove him at laſt to Flee out of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the land of <hi>Moab,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 3; about which Flight he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with God, and for which the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> rebuked him, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Now as to his Flight out of his own Land, too many have followed him over Haſtily (in times of Perſecution) under a pretenſe of providing for their Relations, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> then did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 3, 4: which though I will not abſolutely deny the Warrant of, yet ſurely we may not Flee upon every Light Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion out of that Land or Place in which the Lord hath ſet us, and not without Enquiring of God's Oracles for our Licenſe, eſpecially ſince many have been rebuked by the Lord (and by his Prophets or more Enlightened Servants) for their ſo doing, whereupon good <hi>David</hi> returned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 5. A godly mans heart is Fixed, with reſpect to Evil tydings, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 112. 7; and Chriſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:102526:182"/> forbiddeth going from Houſe to Houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7; and ſome are diſgracefully called <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stars,</hi> Jude 15, and <hi>Hirelings,</hi> who flee upon the Wolfe's appearance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 12. And let it be obſerved, that <hi>David</hi>'s ſpirit was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſo ſad a Caſe, as when he thus Fled, <hi>pſa.</hi> 120. 5, for fear of <hi>Doeg, v.</hi> 2, which hurried him into this ſudden undertaking, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 7, and 22. 3: whereas his Faith was alway more Lively at other times, whileſt he was in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Ziph, pſal.</hi> 54. 4, 5, 7, and in the Cave, <hi>pſal.</hi> 57. 1, 2, 3, and Watched in his own Houſe, <hi>pſa.</hi> 59. 3. 10. 16, and in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah, Pſal.</hi> 63. 8, 9, 10, 11, and when he was in another Cave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 7; although his Outward Condition was then bad enough, but yet he was all this while in his own Land, (as is evident from the reſpective Titles of thoſe Pſalms) and fared from the Lord accordingly. And as we would not fall into the like Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo let us take heed of Weakning our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as <hi>David</hi> then did his, by his Pretending that he was then ſent about <hi>Saul</hi>'s Errand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 2, which did immediately uſher in this Flight of his, firſt unto <hi>Achiſh</hi> the King of <hi>Gath, v.</hi> 10, and then into the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 3.</p>
            <p>And as to thoſe Perſons whom <hi>David</hi> now fled unto, <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines)</hi> too many have alſo followed him in that reſpect, who have ſought for ſhelter unto Things and Perſons of a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> and <hi>Philiſtian</hi> nature, endeavouring to ſecure themſelves by getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour with a Perſecuting and Uncircumciſed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:102526:182"/> Party; and who have alſo Aggravated that Act of theirs, as <hi>David</hi> did, by a freſh complyance with that <hi>Philiſtian</hi> or Groſſer Intereſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 2, from whence there had been formerly a very narrow eſcape, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 12, and for which Mercy, Praiſes had been returned, <hi>pſal.</hi> 34. 1, compared with the Title. But yet <hi>David</hi> did live to Recover what he had hereby loſt, in his after-conflicts with thoſe whom he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complyed with; and nothing ſhort of that, will ſatisfie concerning others, that they are men of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> was once overtaken with a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Dally a little with his Light, in cutting off the Skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Robe privily, which was in order to his having Killed <hi>Saul,</hi> as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants moved, and as himſelf did intimate, by ſaying afterwards, <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth mine hand againſt him,</hi> and by his Heart ſmiting him becauſe he had cut off <hi>Saul</hi>'s Skirt, which could not relate to that Act alone, ſave as that was a Trial made upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which if endured without Reluctancy, might have encouraged him to Perfect his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Motion, whom he was thus far willing to comply with, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 4, 5, 6. It is indeed very ſad to Dally with ones Light at any time, ſince the Eye is ſoon put out, and not to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored without a Miracle. But yet alas how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is this Practice among Profeſſors, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they will not confeſs it,) and how Rare a thing is a truely Tender Conſcience! Thence are ſuch grounded Jealouſies, that one ſcarce knoweth how to Truſt another; thence are ſuch
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:102526:183"/> bold Adventures to Speak and Act at pleaſure; thence are ſuch ſharp Conteſts among men of Differing Opinions, and not ſo much from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance as want of Candour. I am no great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of that Light which is in Every man, but I yet could be glad, if Every one did walk up faithfully unto what Light they have. And though good <hi>David</hi> was a little touched with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, yet was he preſently Heart-ſmitten, ſo as to confeſs his Folly and to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which they ſhall do well to weigh, who Perſevere (upon a like Occaſion) and would Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>David</hi> was alſo once tranſported, in a way of <hi>Self-revenge;</hi> ſo as to deſign the utter ruine of <hi>Nabal</hi>'s houſe, becauſe of his Churliſh and ungratefull carriage towards him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 21, 22. Revenge is very pleaſing to fleſh and blood, and is too apt to be indulged by the beſt, through want of exerciſing that Affection upon our own Corruptions, which is one Evidence of that Repentance not to be Repented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10, 11. But leſt any ſhould cheriſh this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in themſelves becauſe of <hi>David</hi>'s pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, let ſuch alſo remember, that <hi>David</hi> did not put this Purpoſe of his in Execution, but was ſoon ſtopped in that Dirty-lane which led to <hi>Nabal</hi>'s houſe, and Bleſſed God for that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33. And as a Motive to ceaſe from this kind of Anger, let us obſerve how ſpeedily the Lord himſelf Avenged <hi>David</hi> of this <hi>Nabal,</hi> ſo ſoon as the matter was referred to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 38, 39, who hath ſaid, that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is his, and he will Repay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:102526:183"/> 7. Though <hi>David</hi>'s Many Wives, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 5, and 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. 3, was not a Known ſin in thoſe Dayes, as is generally conceived; yet did he alſo undeniably evidence the Inordinacy of his Affection, when he ſo longed (as if he had been ſome Breeding Woman) for thoſe Waters of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which could not then be had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the apparent hazard of their Lives who were to fetch them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 15. It is the Saints Duty to mortifie Inordinate Affection, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, and to Abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11; and <hi>they that are Chriſt's, have Crucified the Fleſh with its Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24; but yet they are long a Dying, as that word <hi>[Crucified]</hi> doth import; and therefore (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) this Failing in <hi>David,</hi> may be Mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Latter end of his Life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1, 15, though poſſibly it might relate unto his Younger dayes, as ſeemeth to be intimated, <hi>v.</hi> 13, and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 10, 13, with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 1. But leſt any ſhould be Encouraged by <hi>David</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let them remember, that he durſt not Drink thoſe Waters which he had ſo Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thirſted after, but poured them out unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16, 17, that ſo we might be inſtructed, how to get rid of ſuch bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I am of Opinion with thoſe who think, that <hi>David</hi> dealt not ſo Righteouſly with that <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who hoping for ſome Reward, did therefore falſly accuſe himſelf as if he had ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 10, whenas it is evident that <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew himſelf, his Armour-bearer ſtanding by till he was Dead of that wound, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4, 5:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:102526:184"/> whereupon <hi>David</hi> forthwith proceeded to take away this poor <hi>Amalekites</hi> life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15, without any forreign Witneſs, which God's Law required in that caſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 30; and did not ſo much as Reprieve him untill the matter might have been known, yea though he confeſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that he then perceived what Temptation this man was under, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 10. Now though it was Juſt with God, thus to meet with this <hi>Amalekite,</hi> as a warning to all Myſtical <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> or Earthly minded men, who will Wrong Themſelves for the Hope of Worldly gain: yet can I not wholly Juſtifie this Act in <hi>David,</hi> however it may be Extenuated by his now being in a Hurry, and in a Military Poſture, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Temptation of thus Vindicating himſelf from having had any hand in <hi>Saul</hi>'s untimely death. Men are too apt to ſecure their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by intrenching upon another's; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Raſh Sentence is put in Execution without ſufficient Proof (at leaſt-wiſe unto the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man's Good Name) without any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Viſible ground, or the Parties own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nay though he doth Declare unto the contrary, beyond what he is bound to doe. But let all ſuch falſe Witneſſes know, that by the Law of God they ſhould be dealt with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they had thought to have done unto their Brother, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20, 21, which God will yet put in Execution, though man doth not, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>David</hi> did ill, in ſparing <hi>Joab,</hi> whom he knew to have been a wilfull Murtherer, both in the caſe of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 9, 10, and <hi>Abner,</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:102526:184"/> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 27. Others alſo have been bold to do the like, whom I would wiſh to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can find any Warrant for their ſo doing from <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 31, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. And if any ſhall make a Plea of <hi>David</hi>'s Practice, let them know, that as his Failings are not written for our Copy, ſo neither did he Pardon <hi>Joab,</hi> but onely Delayed to proceed againſt him, becauſe the other was too Hard for him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 39, untill a fit Seaſon came, and then he gave order for his juſt Puniſhment, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 5, 6, and in the mean while did ſufficiently declare againſt his wicked act, by that dreadfull Curſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 29. And though this kind of Indulgence, hath moſtly prevailed under <hi>Saul</hi>'s Diſpenſation, yet let the Ruling Saints take heed, leſt they be overtaken with the like Temptation, upon ſome Politick account, as <hi>David</hi> then was. And though every Private Perſon be not in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conniving at wilfull Murder, yet all are too apt to ſtop the courſe of Juſtice, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not to Open that Obſtruction, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to ſome more Conſiderable or uſeful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>Joab</hi> then was, according to a Worldly rule of Judging. But as men of <hi>Joab</hi>'s ſpirit muſt expect to be reckoned with by <hi>Solomon,</hi> or Chriſt himſelf, notwithſtanding all their former good Service; ſo let the Indulgers of ſuch a ſpirit know, that <hi>Joab</hi> was a continued Thorn in <hi>David</hi>'s ſide, not onely croſſing him in <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>'s death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 12. 14, but alſo ſadly complying with him in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s Murther, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17. Though it ſhould chiefly ſway with Churches and Civil Governours, not to

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:102526:185"/> to his former Duty, Juſtifying God and taking the blame upon himſelf, as being the cauſe of that rebuke, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>David</hi> doth ſeem to evidence at one time much of a Cruel ſpirit, both in his ſentencing a ſuppoſed Oppreſſour, and in that Execution which he did upon the ſubdued <hi>Ammonites.</hi> When <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent unto him, to draw out a Confeſſion againſt himſelf in the matter of <hi>

From whence we may obſerve, how apt the Beſt are ſometimes, to be <hi>ſevere</hi> in Judging others, untill it come to be their own Particular Caſe.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>David</hi> did thus Hardly Sentence, ſo alſo he was as Cruel, in that Execution which he then did upon the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> putting them under Saws and Harrows and Axes of Iron, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 31. Now as we would not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with the like Temptation, ſo let us take heed of Groſs breach of Duty, which <hi>David</hi> lay under the Guilt of at that time, and which did then occaſion the unuſual Fierceneſs of his Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>David</hi> did ſinfully <hi>Indulge</hi> ſome of his Children; not having Diſpleaſed <hi>Adonijah</hi> in all

It is an ordinary thing for Parents to make their Children Wantons; and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look in them, what is <hi>ſeverely</hi> witneſſed againſt, in others. But let ſuch childiſh Parents bear in mind, how ſadly poor <hi>David</hi> ſmarted for his Fondneſs; ſince <hi>Adonijah</hi> was Ambitious unto the ſhortning of his dayes, becauſe his Father had not Diſpleaſed him at any time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 6, 7; and ſince indulged <hi>Abſalom</hi> would fain have murthered his Father, and did murther his Brother, becauſe <hi>David</hi> did not cut off Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Amnon,</hi> as he ſhould have done, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 17, and becauſe he ſpared <hi>Abſalom</hi> who Bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed that work himſelf. And though <hi>David</hi> was much in captivity to this Diſtemper, yet did he overcome it before his death, and made that up in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s good Education, which had been wanting in him to the reſt, as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>David</hi> doth ſeem not to have dealt ſo fairly, when he gave all <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi>'s Land to <hi>Ziba,</hi> upon his falſe Accuſation of him in the other's abſence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 4; which was the worſe, becauſe <hi>Ziba</hi> had half the Land given him ſtill, after that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicated himſelf from that Aſperſion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. A good man may poſſibly be enſnared by another's Flattery,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:102526:186"/> to Judge unjuſtly before both Parties be heard to ſpeak; and that may betray him (being once engaged) to Perſiſt in what he hath ſo done, at leaſtwiſe not to reverſe it wholly, when the truth is known. The beſt earthen Pitcher may be ſometime carried by One ear, which yet is a ſign of Emptineſs; and fawning Sycophants are apt to be too acceptably entertained, which yet is a Sin and Shame; and when a man is once Engaged in an evil way, 'tis not ſo eaſie to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which ſhould provoke us to take heed of bad Beginnings. But <hi>David</hi> now was not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and though he did fail in this particular act, yet was it his Habitual Purpoſe, to cut off the Privy Slanderer, <hi>pſa.</hi> 101. 5.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>David</hi> confeſſed, that he had ſinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he would needs know his utmoſt Strength, or all the fighting men that were in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 2, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Joab</hi>'s witneſſing againſt it, and earneſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion from it, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, and 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 3, 4. The beſt of men are too apt to Delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Viewing their ſuppoſed ſtrength, in point of Gifts or Graces or any other ſelf-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Advantages, which is Abominable in the eyes of a meer Carnal <hi>Joab,</hi> and much Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto the Lord himſelf. Indeed a man may Lawfully take notice of what Good he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in order to his giving God the Glory of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10; but we are apt to do ſo in a way of Vain glory and Self-pleaſing, as <hi>David</hi> did, which is a great miſcarriage. And let it be obſerved, whether the Declining ſtate of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Diſpenſation in the Latter dayes, be not
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:102526:187"/> attended with the vain Boaſting of a meer Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Numerous Party; which alway hath been the bad Companion of Outward Peace and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proſperity, among the Generality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. But as a Corroſive to ſuch Proud fleſh, let it be duely weighed, that <hi>David</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Provoked by the Devil, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1; and did Confeſs this Sin unto the full, <hi>v.</hi> 8. 17; and never did commit the like again; neither was this Numbring Perfected, or put in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his Chronicles, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 27. 23, 24: and that he was alſo ſharply Corrected by the Lord, by his Loſing Seventy thouſand of what he had ſo Gloried in, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 14; which may be expected by all, as the Righteous Conſequent of their delighting to ſtand in the proud View of their apprehended Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>David</hi> doth alſo confeſs, that he had not Duely ſought the Lord, when he attempted to Remove the Ark, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 13, which ſhould have been carried by the <hi>Levites</hi> upon their Shoulders, <hi>v.</hi> 2, and not by Oxen upon a Cart, as then it was, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 7, and therefore was poor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> ſmitten, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. From whence we may obſerve, that the Beſt men are apt to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Good cauſe Badly; and in Particular by Tranſlating the Burden of that Duty upon <hi>others,</hi> which the Lord hath impoſed upon our <hi>ſelves.</hi> It is good to be Enquring of God in ſuch a caſe, ſince we are naturally prone to <hi>ſpare</hi> our own Shoulders, and to conſult with carnal Policy in matters of a Religious nature. All ſeem Deſirous, that Goſpel-worſhip might be Advanced; but
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:102526:187"/> 
               <hi>few</hi> are willing to take that Ark upon their Backs, ſo long as there are any Oxen to bear it for them, by means whereof it ſhaketh or is Endangered, which doth occaſion ſome freſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous act, unto the Death of ſome, and the Rebuking of all the reſt. Which inſtance may more eſpecially referre unto a time to come; but yet is fully Exemplified at this day: ſince we have been too apt to lay heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon the backs of others; upon which the Ark hath lately ſhaken, which ſome well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> hath endeavoured to hold up by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed means; and therefore perhaps the Lord hath ſmitten them with the Plague, which <hi>Iſrael</hi> is threatned with, in caſe they do neglect their Open ſolemn Worſhip, when called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3, which we in Goſpel-times are bid to hold up, in the face of greateſt outward danger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 27, 28, and are forbidden go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Houſe to Houſe, in a way of deſigning Privacy, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7. And this Ignorance of a Due Order proceedeth from a foregoing Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of conſulting with God's Oracles, through the corruptions of former times; as <hi>David</hi> was therefore ignorant, that this work belonged to the <hi>Levites,</hi> becauſe they had generally Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded God's Ark in the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Lord had ordered, that the Ark ſhould be Placed within the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 33; but <hi>David</hi> brought the Ark into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and left the Tabernacle behind at <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 37. 39, appointing <hi>Aſaph</hi> to miniſter before the Ark, and <hi>Zadok</hi> before the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:102526:188"/> Tabernacle, which was not according to God's Order. It is an hard matter to carry on God's work by Whole-ſale, and not to leave ſome part thereof behind. And though <hi>David</hi> had now got the Better part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ark) into his own Houſe, yet did he hereby occaſion Others to wait upon an Empty Tabernacle. Thus ſome are ſatisfied with a Form of Godlineſs without its Power, whileſt others pretending to the Power do therefore diſregard an inſtituted Form, and little think that both theſe ſhould go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till God give further Order. And as this Partial dealing with God's Appointments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed thus in <hi>David</hi>'s time; ſo I expect it will befall his Diſpenſation in the latter dayes; nor will it be much to be wondred at, if the Beſt ſhall Differ each from other, on this ſide what the Temple typified, eſpecially a little before the final Diſſolution of a Tabernacle ſtate: But to prevent our making light of ſuch a failing, let us remember how oft good <hi>David</hi> was left without Advice from God, after that he had thus put Aſunder what God had Joyned: and that Chriſt (whom <hi>David</hi> typified) would not omit one jot or tittle of the Law till all was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, accounting him the Leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, who ſhall do otherwiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Though <hi>David</hi> had the Ark at home, yet did he uſe to Worſhip in an High Place at <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,</hi> where he had left the Tabernacle, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16. 39. 40, where <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo worſhipped and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 3, 4. And it is evident, that <hi>David</hi> did put
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:102526:188"/> more Honour upon that High-place than upon the Ark, becauſe he had onely <hi>Aſaph</hi> a Levite to miniſter before the Ark, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 37, whereas <hi>Zadok</hi> the prime High-prieſt did ſerve before the Tabernacle in that High-place at <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, v.</hi> 39. From whence we may obſerve, how prone men are to Intermingle ſomething of their own with God's Appointments; and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preferre the Tabernacle-Outſide of a Duty before the Ark of God's Power; and under the Pretenſe of God's Tabernacle to Magnifie their own Inventions or Superſtitious High-places. And let it be duely weighed, that this turning of God's own Tabernacle into an Idolized Form, was the Conſequent (or at leaſtwiſe the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant) of its being ſevered from the Ark, which thoſe are moſt ſubject unto, who do pretend at the Higheſt rate; ſo Dangerous a thing it is to ſever what God hath Joyned, and ſo Natural a thing it is to be Will-worſhippers and not to ſee it. This alſo may prove another great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in theſe Latter dayes, for the preventing whereof, let us remember, that the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Plague (which thinned <hi>David</hi>'s Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers and Warriours) did ſo rage in this High-place at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> as that <hi>David</hi> was <hi>afraid</hi> to come thereat, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 29, 30, and he grew out of conceit therewith ever after, having met with more of God's gracious preſence other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>v.</hi> 28. And thus the Lord at laſt will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up his precious ones, into One fixed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-ſtate of his own appointing, out of all thoſe ſuperſtitious Wandrings and Diviſions, which have been the fruit of their religious Humours;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102526:189"/> as he now ſhewed <hi>David</hi> where that Temple ſhould be built, which yet he was onely ſuffered to make Proviſion for, but might not Set it up, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="18">18. When <hi>David</hi> was in Proſperity, he ſaid, he never ſhould be moved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 6: from whence we may obſerve, how prone the Beſt are to be Secure, which is their ſinfull weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as on the other ſide, in a day of Adverſity to conclude that God hath forgotten to be Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, which <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth to have been his Infirmity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 9, 10. We are apt to walk by Sight, and ſo to be enſnared, by reaſon of our unacquaintance with God's Methods, who keepeth not unto the common road of man's Reaſon, that ſo his People's Faith might be in continual Exerciſe. We are naturally of a very Narrow and Preſentaneous ſpirit, not willing (through ſelf-love) to prepare for Darkneſs in a Sun-ſhine day, nor (at another time) to Hope for mercy, through our Peeviſh Unbelief. But as good <hi>David</hi> overcame Deſpondency, when he remembred that God's Way was in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 9. 13; ſo alſo was his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity rebuked, by the Sudden Hiding of God's face, unto his being Troubled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 7; both which are regiſtred for our Warning and Direction, in relation to thoſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>David</hi> was once tempted to Hold his Peace from Good, whileſt the <hi>Wicked</hi> was before him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 39. 1, 2.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:102526:189"/> which Wicked men cannot endure to hear of; and therefore he calleth it a Parable or Dark Saying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 4, which doth concern the Worldlings Folly, who Truſt in that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Save them from the Grave, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 9, nor prevent the Righteous from having Dominion over them in the Morning, <hi>v.</hi> 14, or when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe. Wicked men are Earthly-minded, who therefore will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nor can endure to hear, that their Life is ſhort, and that their Wealth is worthleſs, and that the poor afflicted Saints ſhall one Day be poſſeſſed of their preſent portion: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Beſt are apt to Speak of ſuch things Darkly, and ſometimes to Hold their peace. How hard it is to bear a Full and Faithful teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to Offenſive Truths! But as it is a bad Sign to be Offended with the Truths of Chriſt, ſo is it the Diſpoſition of Gracious heart to Overcome his ſinfull Silence, as <hi>David</hi> then did, whoſe ſorrow was ſtirred, and whoſe heart was hot within him, untill the burning fire had made a paſſage for his muſing by his Speech, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 2. 3.

            <p>And one would think, there needeth no other Motive, ſave what is hinted from the Duty it ſelf Exhorted unto.

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:102526:191"/> thus Viſibly appear with Crowns upon their heads, then every one will wiſh that He alſo had been a man after God's own heart; which therefore is the firſt Motive to be of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>David</hi> was made to Wait and Suffer much, between his Anoynting and Coronation, that ſo he might be Fitted and Prepared for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: which though (Materially conſidered) it was Afflicting, yet was it of <hi>ſpecial</hi> uſe, ſince he was very Young when firſt Anoynted, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11, and wanted that Experience which is the fruit of Patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not over-haſtily deſire <hi>Saul</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 11. The Anoynted Warring Witneſſes have no great mind to Die; but vet they that Reign with Chriſt muſt alſo Suffer with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12, who learnt Obedience by what he ſuffered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8, and who in Mercy to his People will not Advance them over-ſpeedily, untill he hath firſt Wrought them for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5, and made them Meet to be Partakers of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> came firſt up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had a Mixed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 38, who ſet the reſt a Luſting, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 4; and therefore they might not enter into the Land of Promiſe, till thoſe bad Humours were Purged out, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 29. 30: and when that People's preſent Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſhall be returned, the Lord will firſt bring them into Another Wilderneſs, untill he hath Purged out the Rebels from among them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. Sudden alterations are apt to Overſet the Creature's Weakneſs, and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:102526:191"/> therefore the Lord doth Gradually proceed in doing Good unto them, firſt Preparing their Heart, and then cauſing his Ear to hear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Saul</hi> was Immediately poſſeſſed of his whole Dominion, but <hi>David</hi> was made to Stay, untill he had firſt ſerved two Apprentiſhips, that ſo he might be the better able to drive that Trade, which is the happy Portion of every Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, and another Motive to be of that Number.</p>
            <p>3. When <hi>Saul</hi> was once Dead, though <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had long VVar with his Houſe, yet did he wax <hi>ſtronger</hi> daily, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1, and many fell off unto him, untill his Hoſt was Great, like the Hoſt of God, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12. 22. And let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how this Agreeth with the VVitneſſes, between the time of their Aſcenſion and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet's ſounding; as it hath been made good to Chriſt (in his Intereſts and Members) ever ſince himſelf Aſcended. In the mean while, this is the Portion of every gracious Soul, to wax <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> ever after his firſt Main conteſt with the Body of Sin, which from that time is called the Body of Death, becauſe it groweth VVeaker daily, notwithſtanding ſome leſſer Conflicts afterwards, which may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Peace and Fulneſs of his Spiritual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for the time being; and which alſo is occaſioned by his own Indulging thoſe Spiritual Adverſaries (as <hi>David</hi> did his) againſt whom if all offered Advantages were carefully Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, this VVar might ſooner come unto an happy Iſſue.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>David</hi> was furniſhed with a Spirit ſuitable
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102526:192"/> to that work which God had called him unto, from that very Day wherein he was Anointed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13. And as the Spirit of God was upon Chriſt, becauſe he was <hi>Anoynted, Iſa.</hi> 61. 1; ſo is it alſo given forth unto all his <hi>anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Servants,</hi> according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt. The Saints are poor Creatures in themſelves, but they are encouraged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the help of God's Spirit in their enquiring into myſterious and needfull Truths, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14; in their performance of Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 26; in their Reviving Prohibited Temple-work, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 4, 5; in their honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mannagement of Suffering ſervice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 19, 20; and in their unuſual converſe about Difficult affairs (whether Spiritual, Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary) when called thereunto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28, 5, 6. <hi>Saul</hi> had ſome Ordinary Gifts of Gods Spirit conferr'd upon him, ſuch as a VVicked man may ſhare in; but <hi>David</hi> did experience it's more Peculiar Influences, in his Overcoming that <hi>Goliah</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> fled from; an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meaſure of which Spirit did alſo appear in his unparallel'd VVorthies, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hath been Spiritually Exemplified in all thoſe of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit hitherto, who have done very Strange Exploits, as an Encouragement unto others to be of that Number.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>David</hi> was Succeſſefull in what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, for the Lord was with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 18, enabling him to <hi>ſlay</hi> that Giant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 50; and to Take that impregnable Fort of <hi>Sion,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11. 5; and Preſerving him whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 6. A wicked man
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:102526:192"/> may Proſper in what he putteth his hand unto, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 28; but as it proveth Deſtructive to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32, ſo they have no Promiſe for it, but may Expect the quite contrary, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 29: whereas a Gracious heart hath this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1. 3, becauſe ſuch do Delight themſelves in God, and do commit their way unto him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37. 4, 5, and do belong unto that <hi>Sion,</hi> where God doth command the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 133. 3. The Spirit of God in ſuch doth work Effectually, ſo as to Overcome the Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Adverſary and Strongeſt Hold, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſpicableneſs of their Perſons, and the Weakneſs of thoſe Means which they make uſe of. The onely way to be Succeſſefull in our Attempts, is to become men after God's own heart.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>David</hi> was Accepted in the ſight of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Servants, and of all the People, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 5, who Loved him, <hi>v.</hi> 16, and among whom his Name was much ſet by, becauſe of his Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Wiſdom, <hi>v.</hi> 30; and <hi>Jonathan</hi> Loved him as his own Soul, <hi>v.</hi> 1; nay <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greatly Love him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 21, who afterwards did Fear him, becauſe the Lord was with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 12, and becauſe he did behave himſelf ſo very wiſely, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, which made him at the laſt to turn his utter Enemy, <hi>v.</hi> 29. Every one would fain inherit the Good will of all, and the onely way to do ſo, is to be ſuch as <hi>David</hi> was. Such is the Glory of that Grace and Wiſdom, beſtowed upon a man after God's own heart, as that the Common ſort of people cannot but Love him; yea Hypocrites
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:102526:193"/> themſelves do therefore Reverence him, and are Afraid at the ſight of God in him, whom they have no cauſe to Hate, but onely that they ſo Envy his ſuperiour worth, and Fear that God will Advance him above themſelves; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to become his Enemies, whileſt others of a Groſſer ſpirit Favour him, as the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> was ſett againſt him, and as the Heathens did <hi>Paul</hi> when he was Perſecuted by his Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 27, &amp; 24. 23, &amp; 27. 3, &amp; 28. 2, 7, 16, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>David</hi> was Seen by Others, to be a Worthy man, and one whom the Lord intended to Advance accordingly. <hi>Abigail</hi> could ſay, that God would certainly make him a <hi>ſure Houſe,</hi> becauſe he had fought his Battels, and becauſe no Evil had ever been found in him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 28. Nay <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf Saw and Knew that the Lord was with <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 28, who alſo confeſſed that he was more Righteous than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17, and that he Knew well he ſhould be ſurely King, <hi>v.</hi> 20, as his Son <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had formerly hinted, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 17. Though wicked men and worldly Profeſſors may Revile God's precious ones, yet are they convinced in their Conſciences that they are more righteous than themſelves, and are ſometimes conſtrained to confeſs it, as <hi>Paul</hi> was in part acknowledged by thoſe cenſorious <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13, 14, whom the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> Deified, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 11, as alſo did thoſe Barbarians, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 6. and whom the Devil himſelf acknowledged to be the Servant of the moſt High God, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 17.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:102526:193"/> And as they know them to be men of Worth, ſo alſo they know that God will Advance them, and therefore are glad at laſt to Indent with the Saints for their own Security, as <hi>Saul</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> when he was wearied with his Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and Unſucceſſefull Perſecution, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 21.</p>
            <p>8. The Lord did by a <hi>ſpecial hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> convey the Ephod (together with <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar)</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6; which ſtood him in great ſtead, as being that by which he might come to know God's Mind and Will, and which he did accordingly Experience, unto his great advantage, <hi>v.</hi> 9; who alſo was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that God would Guide him by his Counſel, untill he did receive him unto Glory, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. 24, for God had Promiſed to Guide him with his Eye, and to Inſtruct and teach him the way that he ſhould goe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32. 8, in anſwer to his earneſt Prayer, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 143. 8. A man after God's own heart may comfortably wait upon the Lord for his Direction, and is ſupplyed with Peculiar means accordingly; he hath the Mind of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16, and is endued with that Spirit, which Leadeth into all Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13; whileſt others are left to walk in their own counſels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 12, and Periſh through lack of Knowledge, as <hi>Saul</hi> did when he had loſt the Ephod.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>David</hi> was confident that God would Hear him when he did call unto him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 4. 3, and therefore he would then Look up, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 5. 3; and did accordingly Experience it, when he at any time conſulted with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2. 4. 11,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:102526:194"/> and 30. 8; which he acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 4, &amp; 6. 8, 9; who therefore reſolved to crie unto him, that performeth all things for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 2. Every man would have his Deſires granted, which yet none but a Gracious Soul can Groundedly expect, whoſe Voice is <hi>ſweet,</hi> whoſe Perſon is <hi>accepted;</hi> who goeth unto a loving Father, by the Son, and through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits help: whileſt the Sacrifice of the Wicked is declared to be Abominable. And as the Saints have alway been prevailing in their Prayer, ſo will this Eminently appear in theſe Latter dayes, when God will Hear them whiles they are yet Speaking, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 24, when they ſhall Search for him with all their heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13, and when they ſhall offer unto the Lord a Pleaſant Offering as in the dayes of Old, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>10. God did conſider <hi>David</hi>'s Trouble, and Knew his Soul in Adverſities, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31. 7; and though he Chaſtened him ſore, yet did he not give him over unto Death, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 118. 18; nor did he leave him unto the mercy of his Enemies, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13, 14, 15; but did Miraculouſly Preſerve him from <hi>Saul</hi>'s fury, by a ſtrange Diverſion, when <hi>Saul</hi> had once ſurrounded him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 26, 27, 28; becauſe God did Delight in him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18. 19. The righteous Lord doth Weigh the Path of his Juſt ones, when they are made to walk in Heavy wayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 7; and debateth with them in Meaſure, ſtaying his Rough-wind in the day of the Eaſt-wind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 8. He doth deliver them from too great a death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10, and will not ſuffer them to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:102526:194"/> be Tempted above what they are able to bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13, though Satan doth very much Deſire to have them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. Himſelf is both their Judge and Executioner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32, whileſt Wicked men are delivered up by him unto the Officer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25. God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> are an unconſumed Burning Buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2, whom he knoweth how to deliver out of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9; and doth thus diſpenſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them in way of Special Mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 17.</p>
            <p>11. The Lord was better unto <hi>David</hi> than He would have been unto himſelf; crowning him with his Preventing Goodneſs, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 21. 3. An eminent Inſtance whereof was, when he was Forcibly hindred from Joyning with <hi>Achiſh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. 9, 10, 11, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely would in the Battel have fought againſt <hi>Achiſh,</hi> as his Prudent Lords concluded, <hi>v.</hi> 4; which would have made the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme exceedingly: but therefore the Lord ſo ordered it as that <hi>David</hi> could not Enſnare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he did then Endeavour to have done, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Men after God's own heart, do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience his Overpowring goodneſs, in way of Mercy to themſelves; whom his good Spirit doth not Permit to blemiſh their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prejudice their Peace, as they would doe, if left unto their own Devices and Inclinations. He biddeth that they ſhould Pray, but yet he Acteth for them beyond what they Ask or Think, in anſwer to their Habitual deſires, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:102526:195"/> to the crie of their Condition, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſometimes Expreſs, through want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or from the Prevalency of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. How might the Beſt be Overtaken with ſad Tentations, if the Lord did not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Anſwer before they Call, by keeping them out of the way of ſuch Occaſions! And every one will one day wiſh, that he had been of that Number, whom God doth thus Prevent with unrequeſted mercy.</p>
            <p>12. When <hi>David</hi> onely had it in his Heart to build a Temple, God did Accept his good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntent, and did Reward him for it, as if he had accompliſhed his Purpoſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. 11. The Acceptance of a Willing mind, is one Peculiar priviledge belonging to a true Believer, when non-performance is not from want of Will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11, 12. Chriſt is content to eat his Spouſes Honey-comb, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1; who can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Characters of his Peoples Sighs and Groans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27; and letteth their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires paſs for Actions, or elſe All his Sheep could not be ſaid to have Relieved him in Want, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35, 36, ſince many of them are unable ſo to doe, but yet becauſe the Pooreſt and Weakeſt Saint is not wanting in point of Will, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Reckoned among the reſt, as if he had Done accordingly. Eternal Glory is thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed unto ſuch in way of Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>would</hi> be Infinitely Dutifull; as others <hi>would</hi> be Diſobedient, who therefore are Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed with Everlaſting torments. The
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:102526:195"/> Sinner's good Works ſhall one day be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 22, 23; whileſt a Gracious Soul will bountifully be rewarded for his meer Good will; which is a ſtrong Motive to be of that Number.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>David</hi> was Timely corrected by the Lord, and was not ſuffered to run upon the Score, (as others were) ſave in a caſe of more than Ordinary Provocation, as in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> (wherein he lay almoſt a Year without Rebuke,) and when he Relapſed into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Flight, (where he was ſuffered to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a full year and four moneths, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 7,) after that he had been fairly VVarned of ſuch a like Attempt before, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 12: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Lord ſoon Checked his offer to have killed <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5, and his firſt Flight, both unto <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 1. 5. The <hi>wicked</hi> are permitted to Treaſure up wrath unto themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, whileſt the Lord doth more ſpeedily chaſtiſe his Own, that ſo they might not be condemned with the VVorld, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32; which is no ſmall mercy, ſince his Deferred anger turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fury, and will conclude in ſo much the fiercer Vengeance. Let every one be therefore willing to become a Saint; and as the Saints themſelves would be more Speedily and Gently dealt with, ſo let them take heed of Great tranſgreſſions, and of Relapſing into what the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly rebuked them for, leſt they be then made to Smart as <hi>David</hi> did upon the like occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="388" facs="tcp:102526:196"/>
            <p> 14. The Lord ſeemeth to take no notice of <hi>David</hi>'s Failings, ſave onely in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> excepting which, he is ſaid not to have turned aſide from Any thing that God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all the dayes of his Life, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 5. God threatneth to ſet the Wicked mans ſins in order before his eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of All his ungodly deeds and words, <hi>Jude</hi> 15: but as the Eye of his Juſtice doth not behold Iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> Numb. 23. 21, ſo neither doth he Reproach his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with their Leſſer failings, but Nameth them according to the Better part of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame and Outward converſation. The true Believers Perſon is denominated from his Better part, ſo that it is not He that ſinneth, but Sin that dwelleth in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17: and though their Leaſt miſcarriages are matter of their preſent Shame and Sorrow, yet is it not according to God's Revealed Will, that ſuch things ſhould be mentioned to ſtain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, when Deceaſed. All would be glad to have their Good Name preſerved, the beſt Embalmer whereof is Grace, ſince the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Juſt is bleſſed, but the Name of the Wicked ſhall rot, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 7. Onely the Saints themſelves muſt know, that though their Names be Fairly writ in Heaven, yet may ſome Fouler blot be never wiped off on Earth to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>15. When God had deeply humbled <hi>David</hi> for that miſcarriage in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> he
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:102526:196"/> then Returned to him with Advantage, and gave him a ſecond Son, who was the world's Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and whom the Lord himſelf did call <hi>Jedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi> to ſignifie, that he was <hi>God's Beloved,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24, 25. God is Angry with the Wicked every day, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7. 11; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what he hath formerly done againſt him, yet is not his Anger turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 21: but in relation to his Own, his Anger endureth but a Moment, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 30. 5, he will not <hi>alway</hi> chide, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103. 9, but with Great Mercies will he gather them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 7, according to the dayes wherein he hath Afflicted him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 15. His Soul doth Long to go forth unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (as poor <hi>David</hi>'s did to <hi>Abſalom)</hi> and he <hi>waiteth</hi> to be Gracious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18, offering to be reconciled upon the Loweſt terms that may be, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 13, whoſe Bowels are then troubled for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20, accounting their Light correction to have been Double puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 2, and is more Gracious to his Returning Prodigals, than ever he was before, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22, 23. And who would not be glad to be of that Number, whoſe very Chaſtiſements do onely make way for the fuller evidencing of their Fathers Love?</p>

In which reſpect alſo, the Saints on Earth may be ſaid to have the Pattern of a future Glorious ſtate, as <hi>David</hi> had the Pattern of that Temple, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. 19; for which he was alſo ſuffered to make a large Proviſion, both in relation to its firſt Erecting, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. and following Reparations, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 5. 1: and thus the Living Saints in all Ages, have <hi>ſeen</hi> the Promiſes afar off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, and have abundantly Prepared for that Glory, which yet themſelves on Earth might not ſhare in; and herein is that Saying true, <hi>One ſoweth and Another reapeth,</hi> Joh. 4 37; though yet it was both <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Priviledge and Joy to <hi>ſee</hi> Chriſt's Day at ſuch a Diſtance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56; and both he that <hi>Soweth</hi> and he that <hi>Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> ſhall Rejoyce together, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 36; which therefore is another Motive to be ſuch as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was.</p>

A man after God's own heart, may be Afraid, (at leaſt wiſe Loth) to Die; but yet, as he doth Live to Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21, ſo Death hath loſt its <hi>ſting,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, (becauſe his Treſpaſſes are all forgiven, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13,) and will be to his Gain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21, becauſe he then ſhall Reſt from all his Labours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13, and goeth to receive his Crown, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Wretched <hi>Balaam</hi> would fain have Died the Righteous man's Death, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 10, and all will one day Vote with him; which as they would obtain, ſo let them Live his Life, and labour to be of this little Happy Number. And though ſuch as come ſhort of <hi>David</hi>'s Pitch,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:102526:202"/> may be Admitted into their Maſter's Joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 23; yet they who moſt Abound in Grace, ſhall have a Proportionable entrance miniſtred into Glory, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>28. When <hi>David</hi> was dead and gone, he then was made a Standard unto others, in point of Grace, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was bid to Imitate, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7. 17; who was ſaid to be Reſembled by <hi>Aſa,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15, 11, <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 3, and young <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 1, 2; but not by <hi>Abijam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 3, nor <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 2, nor wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 2. Phariſaical profeſſors are moſt ambitious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called <hi>Maſters,</hi> Matt. 23. 10, or Leaders of the way, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word there importeth: but men after Gods own heart are (next unto Chriſt himſelf) the Guides of others, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, whom they are bid to follow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12, as a Directing <hi>cloud,</hi> Heb. 12. 1, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the end of their Converſation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. And what greater Dignity can be deſired, than that the Lord ſhould thus make his poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be a Secondary Rule whereby he would have others walk.</p>
            <p>29. It is ſaid, that <hi>David</hi>'s fallen Tabernacle ſhall be Raiſed up again, by the Lord's own hand, <hi>Am.</hi> 9. 11; and then his Houſe ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Zech. 12. 8. Which Prophecies relate both unto Chriſt and to his Seed, and Partly have been fulfill'd already, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 16; but yet the Greater (and more
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:102526:203"/> Viſible) Part is ſtill behind. The Saints Holy City or Temporal Rule (partly meant by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Tabernacle) hath for a long time been trampled under foot by Antichriſtian <hi>Gentiles, Rev.</hi> 11. 2; but it ſhall be Raiſed up again, <hi>v.</hi> 15, and then men after God's own Heart ſhall be Advanced, <hi>v.</hi> 18: In the cloſe of which Diſpenſation, Chriſt himſelf will rear up his Tabernacle, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 3, and all the Saints ſhall come with him, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 13, having their Earthly Tabernacles Raiſed up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52, and made like his, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21; and then the Feebleſt Saint ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> whileſt men of <hi>David</hi>'s ſtature ſhall be as Angels, or far above their fellows.</p>
            <p>30. Not onely did <hi>David</hi> (by the Spirit) law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Witneſs on his own behalf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; but God himſelf did alſo Teſtifie concerning him, that he was his Servant, who followed him with all his heart, to do that One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which was right in his eyes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 8. And thus the Lord will one day Witneſs to the Full, what manner of Perſons his faithfull ones have been, and will accordingly reward them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36, 37. 40; whileſt others ſhall be ſuitably Convinced, in order to their final Condemnation, <hi>v.</hi> 41, 42, 43, 45.</p>
            <p>This is the Summe of <hi>David</hi>'s peculiar Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; which the Lord hath therefore left upon record, that ſo others might be ſtirred up to be in love with <hi>David</hi>'s Graces: As they would wear his Crown: as they would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:102526:203"/> for their future <hi>Portion:</hi> as they would Grow in ſpiritual Strength: as they would be Spirited unto their work: as they would be Succeſſefull in what they undertake: as they would Merit the good Eſteem of all: as they would have their real Worth to be obſerved: as they would Know God's Mind and Will: as they would be Heard in <hi>Prayer:</hi> as they would be Conſidered in Adverſity: as they would have <hi>preventing</hi> Mercy: as they would be Rewarded for their good Intent: as they would timely be corrected: as they would have their Frailties to be covered: as they would have God's Love to be renewed with Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: as they would have an Inſight into Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: as they would be Authorized to call God Father: as they would have their Mercies to be <hi>ſure:</hi> as they would be a <hi>publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
